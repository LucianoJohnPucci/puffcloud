They are considering offering competitive rates, even at a loss, in order to attract clients. The main positive points raised by commenters are that offering competitive rates could help the business gain a foothold in the market and attract potential clients. Another positive point is that focusing on small businesses could lead to long-term partnerships and referrals.

They also suggested that the business should place more value on their services and not sell themselves short. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some highlighting the potential benefits of targeting small businesses while others caution against the risks associated with operating at a loss. The comment with the most upvotes advises the author to consider offering a trial period with a discounted rate to attract clients and then gradually increase the rates as the business grows.",
