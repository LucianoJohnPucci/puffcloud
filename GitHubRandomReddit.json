However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shares their frustration with a small business after returning a $50 item that did not meet their expectations. The business advertises a \"30-day return\" policy and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but the customer was charged $14 for return shipping after the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS, resulting in additional costs for the customer. Many commenters expressed their disappointment with the business's handling of the situation, stating that the return policy should have covered the shipping costs and the customer should not have to pay to return a faulty item. Several also suggested that the business should have issued a refund without receiving the returned item, as it was their responsibility to ensure it reached the customer. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the business's actions. The most upvoted comment points out that the business should have honored their return policy and taken responsibility for the lost return package to provide a fair and satisfactory resolution for the customer.",
