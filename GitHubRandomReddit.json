    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the writer's concern about an increase in negative experiences with Stripe payment processor amongst small businesses. The writer noticed a rise in instances where businesses had their funds frozen, were asked for enhanced due diligence, and felt \"held hostage\" by the payment processor, especially when using Stripe's RDR feature. While some commenters shared positive experiences with Stripe, the majority highlighted concerns over the power that payment processors hold over small businesses and the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that payment processors' actions can have a significant impact on small businesses, and there is a need for stricter regulations to protect them. The comment with the most upvotes mentions a similar experience with Square payment processor, stating, \"Took us two months to get our money back. It's terrifying how much power these companies have over our businesses.\"",
