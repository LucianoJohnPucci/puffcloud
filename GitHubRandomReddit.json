    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the author's plan to start a security business targeting small businesses with limited budgets. Many commenters applaud the author's willingness to offer competitive rates, such as $500 for 40 hours, even if it means operating at a loss initially. Some mention that this strategy will help the author stand out in a competitive market and attract more clients.

The most upvoted comment suggests focusing on building a strong reputation and leveraging that to attract high-paying clients in the future.",
