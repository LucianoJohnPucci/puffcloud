Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "In a Reddit thread discussing Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" and its concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, commenters highlighted both positive and concerning aspects of the hypothetical example presented. The scenario involves an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with a $100K investment and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan, projecting 10% annual revenue growth and a eventual sale price of $3-4M in ten years. While some saw potential in this approach and identified possible niches for achieving such growth, others raised doubts about the feasibility of consistent 10% growth and the risks associated with relying on loans. The overall sentiment seemed to be cautiously optimistic, with commenters discussing the potential benefits and challenges of this strategy. The top-voted comment expressed support for the ideas presented in the book, while also acknowledging the importance of thorough research and due diligence in the acquisition process.",
