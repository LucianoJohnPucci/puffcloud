    "Title": "The Reddit post explores the experience of a small business owner who started their business in 2007 after a long career at a failing company. The author highlights their ability to adapt by working from home and surviving the 2008 crash, as well as their current self-employment status along with their husband. However, despite their resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, the author reflects on the challenges of rising costs (up 50% in 2020), which ultimately led them to consider a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. The discussion reflects understanding and sympathy towards the situation, but also raises concerns about the sustainability of small businesses and the impact of rising costs. The overall sentiment is one of support and encouragement for the author's decision, with many acknowledging the fortunate circumstances that allowed them to continue their business for so long. The comment with the most upvotes reads, \"Your determination and adaptability are commendable. Wishing you the best with your new venture!\"",
