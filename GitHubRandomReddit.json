By summer 2017, he had developed his own trading website, growing his initial inventory from $500 to $1,000. Throughout 2018, he hired developers, engaged in influencer marketing, and expanded the user base to over 40,000. However, profitability declined, leading him to eventually stop dedicated work on the site as he focused on school. In Spring 2018, he sold 90% of the site for $2,200, having withdrawn over $12,000 in profits during the business's operation. He learned valuable lessons about entrepreneurship and marketing through the experience.",
