He presents a scenario where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $200k SDE, invests $100k, and finances the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur aims to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author questions the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade and seeks insights on business niches that could support this growth.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $200k SDE, invests $100k, and finances the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. While some commenters find this approach feasible, others question the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade. Additionally, there is a discussion around potential business niches that could support this growth. The overall sentiment of commenters is mixed, with some expressing support for this strategy while others are skeptical. The most upvoted comment raises concerns about the risk involved in relying on a single growth strategy for such a long period of time.",
