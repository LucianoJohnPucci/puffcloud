    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the potential impact of tariffs on a business that imports Asian products primarily to B2B clients. While some commenters see a potential positive impact with the support of domestic businesses, the majority express concern over the already existing premium prices and the reluctance to increase prices further. This raises concerns about loss of customers due to the competitiveness of local products or the inability to absorb the tariff costs. The overall sentiment is one of worry and uncertainty, with most commenters agreeing that the tariffs could have a significant negative impact on the business. The most upvoted comment states, \"It's a difficult situation for small businesses like yours. I hope the tariffs aren't too harsh and your business can weather this storm.\"",
