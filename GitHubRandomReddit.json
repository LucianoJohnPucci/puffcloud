    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a situation in which an assistant manager suspects an employee of theft after noticing unusual patterns in the voided sales log and reviewing security camera footage. The employee is seen taking cash from customers, opening the cash drawer, and voiding sales while appearing to record transactions on his phone. However, there is no footage of the employee pocketing any money. The manager is hesitant to accuse the employee without concrete evidence and plans to report the findings to the owner, seeking advice from the community. The key positive points raised by commenters include the idea of conducting a cash audit and possibly involving human resources or a loss prevention team for further investigation. However, the main concerns raised revolve around the lack of concrete evidence and the potential consequences for the employee. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is understanding and supportive of the manager's dilemma, with suggestions for handling the situation in a professional and thorough manner. The comment that received the most upvotes suggests considering the possibility of the employee recording the transactions for personal protection in case of a dispute, rather than for fraudulent purposes.",
