    "Title": "In a Reddit post, a small business owner challenges the belief that owning a small business is a passive endeavor. They argue that while it requires strategic effort, it is not a hands-off job with the right systems, automation, and delegation in place. Many commenters agree, noting that successful business ownership involves focusing on high-leverage tasks and being proactive rather than simply working long hours. However, some express concerns that the author's experience may not be representative of all small business owners and that true \"passive\" ownership is unrealistic for many. The overall sentiment is one of recognition for the hard work and sacrifices that come with owning a small business, but also a recognition that it can be a rewarding and fulfilling endeavor with the right approach. The top-rated comment echoes the author's sentiment, stating, \"There is no such thing as a completely hands-off business. It takes a lot of effort and strategy to make a small business successful, but it can be worth it in the long run.\"",
