    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the misconception of \"passive\" small business ownership and how, with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, it can become less time-consuming. The commenters agree that hard work is essential, but emphasize the importance of effective management through automation and delegation. Some positive points raised include the benefits of utilizing technology and leveraging resources to streamline business operations, ultimately freeing up the owner's time.
