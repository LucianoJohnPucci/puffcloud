    "Title": "The post in question discusses the author's business journey, which began in 2007 after they left a failing company and utilized their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to start their own business from home. Despite facing challenges such as the 2008 crash and the current COVID-19 pandemic, the author and their husband have managed to sustain their business. However, due to rising costs (up 50% in 2020), the business has become unsustainable, and the author is now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. While acknowledging their luck in not having to close like many other small businesses in 2020, this move has raised concerns about the impact on the author's business and potential loss of autonomy. Many commenters also expressed admiration for the author's resilience and success thus far, offering words of encouragement and support. Overall, the sentiment among commenters was positive, with hope for the author's future success. The most upvoted comment stated, \"I think it's important to adapt and make changes when necessary. You've shown resilience and determination, I have no doubt you will thrive in this new venture.\"",
