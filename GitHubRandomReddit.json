The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that yielded positive results, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The campaign had 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with 4 of those calls leading to booked jobs. The main highlight of the campaign was the indication of buyer intent from immediate needs of the callers. However, some commenters raised concerns about the low frequency of calls (averaging one call every three days) and suggested improving keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for departments to enhance the campaign's effectiveness. Overall, the sentiment is positive with the potential for further success with strategic refinements. The comment with the most upvotes suggests using Google Analytics to track conversions and optimize the campaign.",
