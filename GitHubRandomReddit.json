    "Title": "The discussion on the smallbusiness subreddit centers around suspicions of fake threads being posted, all of which mention a solution called Wosily. These posts are made by new accounts with fabricated post histories and are deleted once brought to attention. The suggestion is made to ban all mentions of Wosily and to implement measures to prevent these fake threads. Key points include the prevalence of these fraudulent posts and the proposed solutions of banning the term and tightening moderation. Concerns are raised about the impact on legitimate users and the effectiveness of these measures. Despite some skepticism, the overall sentiment is one of support for taking action. The comment with the most upvotes suggests setting a minimum account age to post on the subreddit to combat the issue.",
