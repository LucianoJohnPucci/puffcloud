The user has $300K cash to allocate but estimates needing $407,750 for the purchase, including a $1.725M offer (10% down), working capital, and advisor fees. Key concerns are the accuracy of their financial calculations and the reasonableness of their offer compared to the seller?s $1.8M reserve. They seek advice on validating their budget and offer, with suggestions to consult financial advisors, compare industry valuations, and engage business brokers for insights.",
