Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post is centered around the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, as presented in Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build.\" The author explains Deibel's hypothetical example of buying a $1M business with a $100K investment and a 90% SBA loan, projecting a 10% annual revenue growth and a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. Commenters in the thread pointed out that while this scenario seems optimistic, it is not entirely unrealistic. Some shared their own success stories and suggested potential niches for achieving consistent growth, such as renewable energy and technology. However, concerns were raised about the challenges of maintaining 10% growth consistently and the risky nature of acquisition entrepreneurship. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was cautiously optimistic, with some expressing skepticism while others offering encouragement and support. The most upvoted comment, with 71 upvotes, states, \"It's possible, but it takes a lot of hard work and a good bit of luck.\"",
