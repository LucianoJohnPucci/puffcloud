Before automating, identify pain points, map out workflows, and follow a 9-step process: eliminate, reduce, simplify, optimize, automate, document, delegate, outsource (if not a core competency), and measure. Only after streamlining and optimizing processes should automation be considered, as it is merely an efficiency multiplier of existing processes.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the importance of properly utilizing automation in business processes. The majority of commenters agree that it should not be the first step in improving processes, but rather the last. Before considering automation, it is crucial to identify pain points and map out workflows. The suggested 9-step process includes steps such as eliminating, reducing, simplifying, and optimizing processes before automating them.

Overall, the sentiment is largely in favor of the suggested approach, with one commenter stating, \"I've seen too many companies automate terrible processes, leaving them with automated terrible processes.\" This highlights the importance of streamlining and optimizing before automating.",
