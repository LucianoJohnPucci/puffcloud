    "Title": "This Reddit post features a discussion about a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee. However, after receiving the item and realizing it wasn't suitable, they returned it and paid $14 for shipping. The package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS after three delivery attempts and was returned to the sender. The customer requested a refund, but the business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. While some commenters acknowledged the business's right to request the item before processing a refund, many were critical of the business's lack of flexibility and understanding in this situation. The overall sentiment is one of frustration and disappointment towards the business for not adhering to their stated return policy and causing inconvenience and additional costs for the customer. The top-upvoted comment states, \"If the item was returned within the specified timeframe, the business should honor their return policy instead of placing the burden on the customer.\"",
