It is commonly prescribed to treat major depressive disorder and seasonal affective disorder. It is also used as a smoking cessation aid under the brand name Zyban.\n\nWellbutrin works by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which helps to regulate mood and behavior. It is believed that an imbalance of these neurotransmitters can contribute to depression and other mental health conditions.\n\nSome potential side effects of Wellbutrin include dry mouth, headache, nausea, constipation, and dizziness. It may also cause changes in appetite and weight, nervousness, trouble sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. In rare cases, it may cause more serious side effects such as seizures, hallucinations, and increased blood pressure.\n\nIt is important to follow your doctor's instructions and take Wellbutrin as prescribed. Do not suddenly stop taking the medication without consulting your doctor, as this can cause withdrawal symptoms. Also, do not take more than the recommended dose or combine it with other medications without first consulting your doctor.\n\nPrior to taking Wellbutrin, inform your doctor of any other medications you are taking, as well as any medical conditions or allergies you have. It may interact with other medications such as MAO inhibitors, alcohol, and certain antidepressants.\n\nOverall, Wellbutrin can be an effective medication for treating depression, but it may not be suitable for everyone. If you experience any concerning side effects, be sure to talk to your doctor.<|endoftext|>Alarm Clock\n\nAn alarm clock is a device used to wake a person up at a specific time.
