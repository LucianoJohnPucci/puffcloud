    "Title": "After reading through the comments on the Reddit post regarding negotiating a profit margin for a handmade jewelry business, it is clear that many users are offering advice and sharing their own experiences in similar situations. The jeweler is seeking guidance on how to proceed with an opportunity from the owner of a chain of small boutiques, who is interested in carrying their products. Some users suggest researching similar products in the market to determine a fair profit margin, while others recommend negotiating a lower minimum unit requirement to ensure the jeweler is not taking on too much risk. It is mentioned that the boutique owner may be willing to compromise on the minimum unit requirement if the jeweler offers unique and high-quality products. The main concern raised is ensuring that both parties are satisfied with the agreement and that the jeweler is not undervaluing their handmade items. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is positive and encouraging, with many users offering helpful tips and advice. The most upvoted comment suggests setting a minimum unit requirement of 25 units and increasing the profit margin for larger orders as a compromise between the two parties.",
