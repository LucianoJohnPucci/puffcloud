    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the increase in negative experiences with Stripe, a popular payment processor, specifically regarding frozen funds, enhanced due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\". The writer has noticed a rise in these incidents, especially when using Stripe's RDR feature, leading them to be concerned about payment processors having too much control over small businesses. \nMany commenters shared positive experiences with Stripe, citing its user-friendly interface and efficient processing. However, there were also numerous reports of frozen funds, delayed payouts, and the lack of transparency in the reasons behind these actions. Some commenters expressed frustration with the lack of support from Stripe and the difficulty in resolving issues. \nThere was a general sentiment of fear and powerlessness towards payment processors, with several small business owners sharing similar experiences of sudden and unexpected account freezes. The top upvoted comment described how they lost $40,000 to Stripe for failure to verify their business in time, despite already providing all necessary documents. This highlights the main concern raised by the poster and commenters alike - the potential for payment processors to have a negative impact on small businesses without proper accountability.",
