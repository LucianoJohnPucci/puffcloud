    "Title": "The discussion on the growing trend of individuals selling similar products under different names, particularly through importing goods from China, raises concerns about competition and market differentiation. The author mentions a case of a company using the RCA brand name for a two-way radio that is essentially a private label product, and they question how new businesses can gain traction in a market where many are offering the same items.
