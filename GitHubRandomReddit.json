    "Link": "The owner of a custom suit shop on Etsy, with over $54K in sales since launching online in October 2023, faced suspension due to numerous case requests initiated by buyers after the shop was frozen. The owner attributes the issues to 20-25 overdue orders, mainly from customers who failed to provide necessary custom measurements. Despite offering consultations and maintaining good customer feedback, the shop's suspension followed a dispute involving a false review by a customer. The owner expressed distress over the inability to fulfill active orders, the financial impact on their team, and concerns over Etsy?s lack of communication regarding the suspension reasons. They emphasized the importance of diversifying business platforms and expressed frustration with Etsy's automated responses to their appeals.",
