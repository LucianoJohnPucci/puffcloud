    "Title": "The discussion on whether small businesses can truly be \"passive\" centers on the idea that with the right systems and experience, a business owner can reduce their workload through high-leverage tasks, automation, and delegation. While some commenters agree that these strategies can help alleviate the burden of running a business, others highlight the ongoing effort and dedication required in entrepreneurship. This includes potential risks and failures, as well as the long hours and hard work that are often necessary for success. The comment that received the most upvotes emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between working hard and working smart, and acknowledges that being a business owner is not a passive job, but it can still be fulfilling and rewarding with the right approach. Ultimately, the sentiment seems to lean towards the belief that while being a small business owner may not be entirely hands-off, it offers unique opportunities for growth and success.",
