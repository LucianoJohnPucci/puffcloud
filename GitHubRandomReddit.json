    "Title": "The Reddit post in question describes a customer's experience with a small business that advertised a 30-day return policy and a 100% satisfaction guarantee. After the customer returned a $50 item and paid a $14 shipping fee, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender. The business, however, refused to cover the cost of return shipping and insisted on receiving the item back before issuing a refund. This has left the customer frustrated and considering a chargeback, as they feel the business is not honoring its return policy fairly. Many commenters expressed disappointment with the business's handling of the situation and urged the customer to pursue a chargeback. The top-rated comment noted the business's questionable customer service and lack of empathy towards the customer's additional costs. Some commenters also highlighted the potential legal issues surrounding the business's return policy. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was negative towards the business and sympathetic towards the customer's frustration. One commenter summed up the sentiment by stating, \"The business should not have advertised a return policy they were not willing to honor.\"",
