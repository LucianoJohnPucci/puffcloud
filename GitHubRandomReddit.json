    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature, citing that it triggered \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds despite having an established business with no issues. The owner expresses disappointment in the lack of clear communication from Stripe support, which provided only generic responses, causing cash flow problems. The discussion is rife with positive points on the benefits of RDR, such as its effectiveness in handling disputes and protecting businesses. However, concerns are raised about the seemingly arbitrary triggering of enhanced due diligence and the lack of transparency in the process. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while RDR is useful, the lack of clear communication and the potential for sudden holds is a cause for concern, with some commenting on the potential impact on cash flow and business operations. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the need for Stripe to improve their communication and provide more clarity in their processes.",
