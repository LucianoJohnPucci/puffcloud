    "Title": "Stripe is a popular payment processor for small businesses, but recent horror stories have raised concerns about their power over these businesses. Many commenters have pointed out positive aspects of Stripe, such as its user-friendly interface and efficient payment processing. However, they have also expressed concerns about funds being frozen, requests for enhanced due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\" by Stripe. These issues seem to be more prevalent when enabling Stripe's RDR feature. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is one of worry and frustration over the possibility of having their businesses disrupted by Stripe. The most upvoted comment suggests that businesses should diversify their payment processors to avoid being solely reliant on Stripe.",
