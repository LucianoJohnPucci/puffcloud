However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a situation where a customer purchased a $50 item from a small business with a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed,\" the package was returned to the sender. The business refused to pay for return shipping, leading to the customer facing an additional $14 cost and considering a chargeback. The majority of commenters expressed frustration and disappointment with the business's lack of responsibility and failure to honor their return policy. They emphasized the importance of customer service and standing by one's policies, and some even suggested seeking legal action or warning others about the business. The top upvoted comment stated, \"That's ridiculous. The business should either provide a prepaid shipping label or issue a full refund immediately. It's unethical to make the customer pay for their mistake.\" Overall, the sentiment from commenters was negative, highlighting the need for businesses to carefully handle returns and customer issues to maintain trust and satisfaction.",
