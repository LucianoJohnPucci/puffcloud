    "Title": "The post in question is from a business owner with nine years of experience who is struggling to sell their company after nine months on the market. Despite price reductions and employing a new broker, they have had no success and are now seeking advice from the Reddit community. The owner is considering either continuing with the broker, trying to sell the business independently, or exploring creative selling strategies. They also inquire about the feasibility of an employee buyout and potential options for closing the business if selling proves unviable. The concern is for the owner to be fairly compensated for their investment of time and effort in the business. \n\nThe majority of commenters advise the owner to continue working with the broker, while also exploring alternative options such as utilizing social media for marketing, reaching out to personal connections, and utilizing business forums and sale websites. Some suggest reducing the asking price or offering incentives to potential buyers. Concerns are raised about the difficulty of selling a small business in the current market and the potential for low offers or deals falling through. The overall sentiment is sympathetic and supportive, with many sharing their own experiences and offering advice. The comment with the most upvotes advises the owner to prioritize closing the business successfully rather than focusing on getting a high price, as the primary goal should be to move on and start a new venture.",
