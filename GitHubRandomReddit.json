    "Title": "The Reddit user in question is contemplating purchasing a waste management business for $1.9M, which generated $1.9M in revenue, $325K in net income, and $390K in EBITDA in 2023. They currently have $300K in cash and anticipate needing $407,750 for the purchase, including a 10% down payment, working capital, and advisor fees. Many commenters advise the user to consult with financial advisors, compare industry valuations, and engage business brokers for insights to validate their budget and offer. Some positive points mentioned include the stability of the company's revenue and net income, as well as the potential for growth in the waste management industry. However, key concerns raised include the accuracy of the user's financial calculations and whether their offer is reasonable compared to the seller's $1.8M reserve. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be cautious, with an emphasis on seeking professional advice and thoroughly researching the business and industry. The most upvoted comment encourages the user to \"be diligent and skeptical in your calculations and don't be afraid to walk away if the numbers don't make sense.\"",
