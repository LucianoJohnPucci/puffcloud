The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which resulted in $100 spent over 21 days, 1,800 impressions, and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), commenters brought up the need for refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve the campaign effectiveness. This would address the concern that the campaign only yielded one call every three days and would likely improve the overall conversion rate. Many commenters also noted that the fact that most callers had immediate needs and showed buyer intent was a positive aspect of the campaign and should be capitalized on in future plans. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that the campaign was successful but could be further optimized for better results. The most upvoted comment stated, \"Refining keyword targeting and creating separate ad groups for each department is a great idea. It will definitely improve the effectiveness of the campaign and lead to a higher conversion rate.\"",
