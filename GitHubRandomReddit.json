    "Title": "The creator of everm?e, a digital locket designed for the U.S. and Canadian markets, recently sought feedback on their website's low conversion rates. With only 2 sales from 2,500 visitors, they are looking for insights on specific pages, user demographics, and potential improvements. While the product has generated interest in-person and from events like the LVMH Prize, online marketing efforts have been hindered by a small budget and lack of product familiarity. Attempts at advertising on various platforms have yielded minimal success, and exploring influencer partnerships has proven challenging. Commenters are offering constructive criticism and collaboration opportunities to boost sales. The overall sentiment of the discussion is positive, with many pointing out the potential of the product and offering valuable suggestions. The most upvoted comment cautions against solely relying on influencer partnerships and suggests seeking partnerships with fashion and tech publications.",
