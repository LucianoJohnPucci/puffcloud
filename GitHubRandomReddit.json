    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author discusses their plan to start a security business targeting small businesses with limited budgets. They are considering offering competitive rates, such as $500 for 40 hours, even if it means operating at a loss initially. The main positive points raised by commenters include the potential for growth and expansion, as well as the opportunity to tap into a potentially underserved market. However, concerns were also expressed about the sustainability of such low rates and the potential negative impact on the industry as a whole. Some commenters encouraged the author to also focus on providing quality services rather than just low prices. The overall sentiment from commenters was that it is a risky strategy but could potentially pay off if executed well. The comment with the most upvotes suggested that the author should focus on building a strong reputation and leveraging referrals rather than relying solely on low rates.",
