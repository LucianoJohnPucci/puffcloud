    "Title": "The Reddit post by a small business owner who works over 70 hours a week sparked a discussion on the feasibility of passive business ownership. While some commenters acknowledged that effective systems and delegation can reduce time commitment, they also emphasized the importance of staying engaged. The main positive points centered around the idea of focusing on high-leverage tasks to increase efficiency and workload management. On the other hand, the main concerns raised revolved around the difficulty of achieving complete disengagement and the potential negative impact it can have on the success of a business. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was that while passive business ownership may be possible, it requires constant effort and involvement to maintain and grow the business. The comment with the most upvotes echoed this sentiment, stating, \"Passive ownership is a myth. Businesses still require your attention and effort, even if you have a great team and systems in place.\"",
