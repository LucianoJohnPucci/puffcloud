    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a small business owner's concerns about claims of 80% price increases in aluminum from their suppliers, citing tariffs and industry pricing restrictions. Commenters largely agree that the price increases are legitimate and reflect market forces, rather than collusion. Many state that the tariffs have had a significant impact on aluminum prices, leading to increases in both raw materials and finished products. Others point out that industry pricing restrictions are likely also contributing to the price hikes. Main concerns raised include the potential for suppliers to collude and take advantage of the situation for their own profit. However, the overall sentiment is that the price increases are justified and not solely due to collusion. The top upvoted comment reinforces this sentiment, stating, \"The tariffs have had a massive impact on commodity prices, it's not just aluminum. It sucks for small businesses, but unfortunately, it's a reality we have to face.\"",
