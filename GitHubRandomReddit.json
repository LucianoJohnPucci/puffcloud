Positive points also include advocating for transparency, cooperation, and caution in the development of AGI. Some concerns raised include the potential for AGI to undermine human jobs and security, the need for ethical considerations, and the possibility of unforeseen consequences. While there is a general sentiment of excitement and curiosity about the development of AGI, there is also a sense of caution and calls for responsible and ethical advancements. The comment with the most upvotes comes from u/mankindriven downwards, stating, \"We may be a long way off from full AI, but we are making steady progress, and it's important to start considering the ethical and societal implications now.\"",
