    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the common misconception among entrepreneurs that \"a good product will sell itself\" and asks for experiences from others in effectively marketing their products. Many commenters agree that a good product alone is not enough and highlight the importance of having a strong marketing strategy and engaging with potential customers online. They also share personal experiences where a successful product needed initial marketing efforts to gain traction. Concerns raised include the potential for businesses to fail if they solely rely on the product to sell itself, and the need to continuously adapt and innovate to stay ahead in the market. The overall sentiment is that a good product is important, but effective marketing and engagement are equally crucial for success. The top comment with the most upvotes states, \"I've learned that it takes just as much effort and strategizing in marketing as it does in creating a great product. They go hand in hand.\"",
