    "Title": "There has been a recent increase in concerns about Stripe payment processor horror stories, where small businesses are experiencing frozen funds and being subjected to enhanced due diligence, leading to feeling \"held hostage.\" This spike in incidents is believed to be linked to the use of Stripe's RDR feature. Despite the convenience and user-friendly interface of Stripe, many small business owners are worried about the power that payment processors have over their businesses. While some commenters have highlighted the positive aspects of Stripe, such as its reliability and ease of use, others have shared their own negative experiences with the platform, including fund holds and sudden account terminations. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of caution and frustration, with many advocating for small businesses to have more control and transparency when it comes to payment processors. The top-voted comment expressed this sentiment, saying \"Payment processors shouldn't have this much power over small businesses. There should be regulations to protect us from these horror stories.\"",
