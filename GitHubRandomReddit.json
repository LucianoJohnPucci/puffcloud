However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post sparked a discussion on the topic of customer satisfaction and return policies. The majority of commenters expressed frustration at the business for not honoring their return policy, which stated a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee. Many felt that the business was being unfair by not covering the cost of return shipping, despite the customer following the instructions and paying for the original shipping. Some raised concerns about the unclear language of the return policy and the added inconvenience and cost faced by the customer. The overall sentiment among commenters was that the business should have been more transparent and understanding, and that the customer should not have to face additional expenses for a return that was not their fault. One comment, which received the most upvotes, stated, \"It's common courtesy for businesses to cover return shipping costs for faulty or unsuitable items. I wouldn't blame the customer for seeking a chargeback in this situation.\"",
