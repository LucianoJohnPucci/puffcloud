    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a college student seeks advice for their mother's struggling high-end women's clothing store. The store, which specializes in classy dresses for a \"mother of the bride\" audience, has seen low foot traffic and is facing financial difficulties after 20 years of success in the fashion industry. Some key positive points discussed by commenters include the store's unique offerings such as custom dresses and jean resizing, as well as its location in a high-income suburb. However, many express concern about the store's pricing range, which may be too high for the current market. The overall sentiment of commenters is sympathetic towards the mother's situation and eager to offer helpful strategies to improve business, rather than suggesting closing the store as the best option. The comment with the most upvotes advises the student to explore digital marketing and social media to attract a younger audience and diversify their customer base.",
