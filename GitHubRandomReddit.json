    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the author's experience of starting their business in 2007 after working at a failing company for 18 years. They were able to leverage their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to succeed, working from home to avoid real estate costs and survive the 2008 crash. However, despite their resilience, the business has become unsustainable due to rising costs (up 50% in 2020) and the COVID-19 pandemic. The author and their spouse are considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor, acknowledging that they are fortunate not to have closed their business in 2020 like many others. The overall sentiment of the commenters is empathetic towards the author's struggles and applaud their determination in facing the challenges of entrepreneurship. Many highlight the strength of their relationship with their spouse as a key positive point and the importance of adapting to changing circumstances. The main concern raised is the impact of rising costs on small businesses, especially during the pandemic. The comment with the most upvotes is from a user who shares their own experience of starting a business during a recession, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and being open to new opportunities.",
