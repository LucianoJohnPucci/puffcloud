The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days and resulted in 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. This yielded a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs booked. The campaign showed that most callers had immediate needs, highlighting buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), the average of one call every three days was not considered ideal. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. The key positive points discussed include the decent ROAS and the immediate buyer intent shown by most callers. However, concerns were raised about the low number of calls and the need for further optimization and refinement. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many suggesting strategies to improve the campaign. The comment with the most upvotes suggested implementing a retargeting campaign to reach potential customers who have already expressed interest in the business.",
