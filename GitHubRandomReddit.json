    "Title": "The author of a Reddit post shared their experience building a SaaS product called Answer HQ, a customer service automation tool for small businesses. They launched an MVP and received positive feedback from early users, leading to their first customer insisting on paying for an annual plan after seeing a 30% increase in sales and fewer customer emails. A second customer also signed up for a monthly subscription after seeing a social media testimonial. While the revenue is not substantial, the author is thrilled with the validation and emphasizes the importance of MVPs, customer feedback, and good service. However, some commenters expressed concerns about the sustainability of the company with just one person managing it and the potential for burnout. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was positive and supportive, with many highlighting the importance of starting small and listening to customers. The comment with the most upvotes reads, \"Congrats on your success so far! It's inspiring to see someone take the lean approach and be rewarded for it.\"",
