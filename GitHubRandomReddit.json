    "Title": "This Reddit post highlights the struggles of a cafe owner with two businesses - a 4-year-old cafe experiencing a 30% decline in revenue and a 6-month-old cafe that initially grew but has since plateaued. Other small businesses in the area are also facing similar challenges, leading to the question of whether this trend is localized or a broader issue. Many commenters agreed that the current economic climate, specifically the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has greatly affected small businesses. Some positive points mentioned include adapting to online ordering and delivery options, as well as providing quality products and customer service. However, a major concern raised is the lack of government support for small businesses during this difficult time. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that small businesses are facing significant struggles, but it is also important to support and uplift each other during these tough times. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"It's a tough time for all small businesses, but we need to work together and support each other to make it through.\"",
