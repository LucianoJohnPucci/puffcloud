    "Title": "The Reddit post delved into the common misconception among entrepreneurs that \"a good product will sell itself\" and sought input from other users on their experiences with this advice. The discussion highlighted the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement in order to drive sales and ultimately, the success of a product. Many commenters shared positive experiences of seeing their sales increase after implementing strategic marketing tactics, with some pointing out the role of customer reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations in boosting sales. However, a major concern raised was the need for entrepreneurs to not solely rely on the quality of their product, but rather actively promote and engage with potential customers through various mediums. The overall sentiment in the comment section was that while a good product is important, effective marketing and engagement play a crucial role in driving sales and success. The top upvoted comment by username \"jimmy23\" stated, \"I learned the hard way that a good product isn't enough. You have to put in the work to get it in front of people and build brand awareness.\"",
