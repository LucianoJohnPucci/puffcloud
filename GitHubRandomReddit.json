However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The business had advertised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but when the customer returned a $50 item, they were charged an additional $14 for shipping as USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed.\" The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, leaving the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Many commenters sympathize with the customer and see it as a lack of fairness and transparency by the business. Some point out that the business should have communicated the return process more clearly and suggest that the customer should have been reimbursed for the return shipping cost. There is a general consensus among the commenters that the business should have honored their return policy and saved the customer from incurring additional costs. The top-voted comment expresses frustration and criticizes the business's lack of empathy towards the customer's situation.",
