    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the rising concerns among small business owners about Stripe's increasing tendency to freeze accounts and demand enhanced due diligence, causing them to feel \"held hostage.\" Many question whether this is a growing trend or merely confirmation bias, with some experiencing immediate account holds when enabling Stripe's RDR feature. The community expresses alarm about the power payment processors hold over small businesses. Some positive points mentioned include Stripe's ease of use and competitive pricing, but the main concern is the lack of transparency and communication in account freezes and holds.
