    "Title": "Many commenters express concerns about Stripe's payment processor and their apparent increase in \"horror stories\". These involve small businesses having their funds frozen, being asked for enhanced due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\". Some note that these issues seem to be more prevalent when enabling Stripe's RDR feature. Although there are a few positive comments about Stripe's overall user experience and ease of use, the majority of the discussion revolves around the power that payment processors have over small businesses. Commenters worry about the lack of accountability and transparency in the process and suggest alternative payment options to avoid such issues. Overall, the sentiment is negative and frustrated, with many expressing a need for better regulations and protections for small businesses using payment processors. One of the most upvoted comments echoes this sentiment, stating \"Payment processors are becoming too powerful and are abusing their position. There needs to be stricter regulations to protect small businesses from these practices.\"",
