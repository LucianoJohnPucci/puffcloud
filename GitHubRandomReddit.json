It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and inquires about specific small business niches that might fit this model.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which proposes the idea of acquisition entrepreneurship through a simplified mathematical example. The hypothetical scenario involves purchasing a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) using a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The post highlights the potential for growth by consistently increasing business revenue by 10% annually, resulting in a potential sale value of $3-4M after ten years. However, commenters question the feasibility of sustaining 10% growth over a decade and offer insights on specific niche industries that may fit this model. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with some individuals expressing skepticism about the long-term growth projection. The top upvoted comment suggests that the provided example is only applicable to a specific type of small business and may not be realistic for all entrepreneurs to achieve.",
