Deibel presents a simplified scenario where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller Discretionary Earnings (SDE) with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur aims to grow the business by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M after ten years. The author questions the feasibility of consistent 10% annual growth for a business achieving $1.5M yearly revenue and seeks insights on potential small business niches that could meet this profile.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author shares their thoughts on Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which explores acquisition entrepreneurship. The scenario discussed involves an entrepreneur purchasing a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the business by 10% annually and eventually sell it for $3-4M after ten years. The main positive points raised by commenters include the low initial investment and potential for high returns, as well as the accessibility of SBA loans for small business acquisitions. However, some express concerns about the feasibility of consistent 10% annual growth and the potential challenges in finding niches that could meet this profile. The overall sentiment among commenters is generally positive, with many acknowledging that it is possible to find businesses with these characteristics, but it may not be as easy as the scenario presented in the book. The most upvoted comment suggests that finding a small business in a growing industry or market could be a potential niche that could meet this profile.",
