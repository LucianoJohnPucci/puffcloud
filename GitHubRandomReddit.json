    "Title": "The post details the story of an individual who started their own business in 2007 after years of experience in a failing company. By working from home, they were able to save on real estate costs and survive the 2008 crash. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the business saw a steep rise in costs (up 50% in 2020), making it unsustainable. The author and their husband are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor as a solution. While some commenters praise the author for their perseverance and success in navigating difficult circumstances, others express concerns about the future of small businesses and the potential risk of relying on a single vendor. The overall sentiment seems to be empathetic towards the author's struggles and admiration for their resilience. The comment with the most upvotes suggests considering diversifying sources of income for greater stability.",
