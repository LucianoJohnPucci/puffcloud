    "Title": "The Reddit discussion centered around a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy. The customer had purchased a $50 item with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but ended up returning it and paying $14 for shipping. However, due to USPS marking the package as unclaimed and it being returned to the sender, the customer faced an additional $14 cost. The main concerns raised were that the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item back, creating a frustrating situation for the customer who now considered a chargeback. \n\nThe key positive points mentioned by commenters were that the customer had followed the return policy and was in the right, and that the business should honor their guarantee and cover the return shipping cost. Many also pointed out that the customer faced a significant loss compared to the business's $14 shipping cost and that the business should value customer satisfaction over their own profit. \n\nThe overall sentiment of the commenters was frustration and disappointment towards the business's lack of empathy and adherence to their own return policy. Many saw this as a breach of trust and felt that the business was not treating their customers fairly. The most upvoted comment stated: \"If the business wants to have a 100% satisfaction guarantee, they should honor it and not make the return process difficult for the customer. It's basic customer service.\"",
