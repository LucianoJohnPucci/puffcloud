    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author expresses frustration with the lack of support for social media as a marketing tool at their family-owned organic grocer. Despite having a background in advertising, all drafted social media posts have been rejected and management views social media as a casual platform instead of a strategic asset. This has also created challenges in outside sales, with the author feeling intimated by management dynamics. Commenters offer advice on how to effectively communicate the value of social media without appearing condescending, with some suggesting drawing on success stories in similar industries and using data to back up the effectiveness of social media in marketing. Overall, the sentiment is that the author is facing a difficult situation, but with determination and a strategic approach, it is possible to change management's perspective. The comment with the most upvotes suggests approaching management with concrete ideas and proposals for using social media, rather than simply discussing its value in abstract terms.",
