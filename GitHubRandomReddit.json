Many commenters were intrigued by the idea and praised the technical aspect of the post for its creativity and complexity. Some also expressed their excitement for the potential advancements in AI and its impact on chess strategy.

The overall sentiment seemed to be one of fascination and curiosity, with a mix of caution and skepticism.
