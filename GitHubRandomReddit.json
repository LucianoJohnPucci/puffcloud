    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer who ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" However, after returning the item, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Many commenters praised the business for offering a return policy and acknowledged that the customer should have provided a valid address. However, many raised concerns about the business's refusal to pay for return shipping and insisting on receiving the item before processing the refund, causing frustration for the customer and possibly leading to a chargeback. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that the business's actions were not in line with their return policy and left the customer feeling dissatisfied. The comment with the most upvotes suggested that the business should have communicated their policy more clearly and offered a return label to avoid any additional costs for the customer.",
