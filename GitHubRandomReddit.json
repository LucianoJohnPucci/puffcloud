    "Title": "The Reddit post in question discusses a small business owner who is facing financial struggles and considering providing paid time off (PTO) to their hourly employees, one of whom is underperforming and requesting PTO and holidays. The post has garnered a lot of engagement, with commenters offering valuable advice and sharing their own experiences. Many commenters believe that offering PTO is crucial for both employee satisfaction and productivity, and it should also be seen as a norm for hourly workers. They also suggest finding ways to cut costs and prioritize PTO as a way to retain good employees and avoid turnover costs. However, the author's main concern is the financial constraint and the challenge of meeting employee demands while the business is still in its early months. The overall sentiment is understanding and empathetic towards the author's situation, with some suggesting alternative solutions such as offering unpaid time off or limiting the number of employees eligible for PTO. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the importance of investing in employees and considering the long-term benefits of offering PTO.",
