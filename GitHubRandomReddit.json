    "Title": "The Reddit post highlighted the story of the author who started their business in 2007 after working for 18 years at a failing company, using their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to become successful. They were able to avoid real estate costs by working from home and survived the 2008 market crash. However, with rising costs (up 50% in 2020) and the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the business has become unsustainable. The author and their husband, who are both self-employed, are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor as a solution. While some commenters praised the author's determination and success in a difficult market, others expressed concerns about the long-term viability of the business model and the potential impact on their income. The overall sentiment seemed to be one of empathy for the challenges faced by small businesses and admiration for the author's resilience. The most upvoted comment, with 185 upvotes, acknowledged the author's hard work and wished them well in their future endeavors.",
