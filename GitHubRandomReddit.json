    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the recent increase in import duties and processing fees charged by UPS and DHL, which has led to added costs for US shoppers and small business owners, ranging from $20 to over $50 per shipment. Many commenters express frustration and concern over the impact these added expenses will have on their businesses and personal budgets. However, there are also some positive points highlighted, such as the potential for local shipping companies to gain more business and the hope for negotiations to lower the fees. The overall sentiment of the commenters is largely negative, with some suggesting boycotts and others calling for government intervention. The most upvoted comment by user u/Texas12 expresses the sentiment of many, stating \"This is unacceptable. Our businesses are already struggling enough, and now we have to deal with even more fees? It's ridiculous.\"",
