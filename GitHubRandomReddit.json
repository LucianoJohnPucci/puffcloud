    "Title": "This Reddit post sparked a discussion about a small UK engineering company facing difficulties with an overseas customer in the UAE. The customer requested a custom product with a net 60 payment term, which posed a financial risk for the owner. Despite negotiating for a net 30 payment term, the owner ultimately chose not to proceed with the order. Many commenters shared their positive experiences with large companies, highlighting their professionalism and willingness to compromise.
