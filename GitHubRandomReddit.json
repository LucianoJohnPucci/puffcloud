    "Title": "The Reddit post highlights a frustrating situation where a customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable and returning it, the customer paid $14 for shipping. However, due to three failed delivery attempts, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and it was returned to the sender. The customer requested a refund but the small business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item back before processing the refund, leading to an additional $14 cost for the customer. The main positive points discussed include the small business's return policy and the customer's initial satisfaction with the product. However, key concerns raised by commenters include the inconvenience and additional cost faced by the customer due to the failed delivery and return shipping, as well as the perceived unfairness of the business not covering the return shipping as part of their guarantee. The overall sentiment among commenters is one of frustration and disappointment, with many sympathizing with the customer and criticizing the business for not honoring their return policy. The comment with the most upvotes points out the irony of the situation, stating \"The business has a '100% satisfaction guarantee' but doesn't seem to be concerned with the satisfaction or convenience of their customers.\"",
