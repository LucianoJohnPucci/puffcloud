It includes the right to make decisions about important aspects of a child's life, such as their education, health care, and religion. It also includes the responsibility to provide for the child's basic needs, such as food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nIn most cases, parental responsibility is automatically given to both parents of a child, regardless of whether they are married or not. However, in cases where only one parent has parental responsibility, the other parent may need to apply for it through a court order or agreement with the other parent.\n\nParental responsibility also includes the duty to protect and care for the child, as well as the responsibility to have a positive influence on their child's development.\n\nHaving parental responsibility does not necessarily mean that the parent has physical custody or full-time care of the child. It is possible for a non-custodial parent to have parental responsibility and be involved in making decisions about their child's life.\n\nIn cases of divorce or separation, both parents are still expected to have parental responsibility and make joint decisions about their child's upbringing and welfare, unless a court order states otherwise.\n\nIt is important for parents to understand their legal rights and responsibilities towards their child and to communicate effectively to make decisions that are in the best interest of their child.<|endoftext|>List of foods\n\n1.
