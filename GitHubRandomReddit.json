    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a handmade jewelry business owner is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with the owner of a chain of small boutiques. The boutique owner wants to carry their products but is asking for a minimum of 50 units of each design to be stocked in all of their stores. The main positive points raised by commenters include the potential for increased exposure and sales, as well as the opportunity to establish a long-term partnership with the boutique owner. However, the main concern raised is the potential financial risk for the jeweler in producing such large quantities, as well as the difficulty in determining a reasonable profit margin without previous experience with high quantities. Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment of the commenters is optimistic and encouraging, with many offering practical advice and insight. The comment with the most upvotes suggests negotiating a trial period with a smaller number of units to test the market and build trust before committing to larger orders.",
