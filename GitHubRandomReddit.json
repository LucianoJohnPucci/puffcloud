Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "The discussion on Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build\" book introduces the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with a $100K investment and a 90% SBA loan, projecting a 10% annual revenue growth and a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The conversation highlights the potential opportunities and challenges of such a strategy. Some positive points include the potential for acquiring an established business with a solid foundation and a lower risk compared to starting from scratch. However, there are concerns about the realistic nature of consistent 10% growth and the ability to scale a business in a niche market. There are also suggestions for specific niches that could achieve this growth trajectory, such as healthcare, technology, and renewable energy. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is mixed, with some seeing potential and others questioning the feasibility. The most upvoted comment notes the importance of thorough research and due diligence in selecting the right business and niche for successful acquisition entrepreneurship.",
