    "Title": "This Reddit post centers around a small business struggling financially and dealing with a request for paid time off (PTO) from one underperforming hourly worker. The owners are seeking advice on whether it's appropriate to offer PTO to hourly employees given their current financial situation. \n\nSome commenters suggest offering PTO as a way to retain employees and improve morale, with a few mentioning the importance of work-life balance. Others point out the potential legal and financial implications of granting PTO to only some employees. The main concern raised is the impact on the business's already strained finances. Overall, the sentiment is sympathetic towards both the owners and the employee, with several commenters suggesting finding a compromise or alternative solution. The comment with the most upvotes suggests offering a limited amount of PTO, such as one day per quarter, to all employees to maintain fairness and avoid financial strain.",
