After successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. The customer insisted on net 60 payments, which the owner found untenable due to the upfront costs of custom work. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still risky for the owner. Ultimately, the owner chose not to proceed with the order, prioritizing peace of mind over financial risk. They sought to hear from others about similar experiences with large companies.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed a small UK engineering company's experience with an overseas customer in the UAE who requested a custom product but had difficulties during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. The owner found the customer's insistence on net 60 payments untenable and settled for net 30, still risky for the owner. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic towards the owner's decision to prioritize peace of mind over financial risk. Some of the key positive points highlighted by commenters were the owner's clear communication with the customer and willingness to negotiate, as well as the importance of setting clear payment terms from the beginning. However, many expressed concerns about the risks of working with larger companies and the challenges of doing business internationally. The top upvoted comment with 66 upvotes stated, \"It's unfortunate that the owner had to turn down an order, but it's better than risking their business for an unreliable customer's demands.\"",
