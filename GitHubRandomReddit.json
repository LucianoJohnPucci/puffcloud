The scenario involves buying a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200K SDE, financing it with a $100K investment and a 90% SBA loan. The expectation is to grow revenue by 10% annually and sell the business for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of achieving consistent 10% growth and inquires about suitable small business niches that could support this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author highlights the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship as outlined in Walter Deibel's book *Buy then Build*. The scenario presented involves buying a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200K SDE, using a $100K investment and a 90% SBA loan, with expectations of 10% annual growth and eventual sale for $3-4M in ten years. The discussion centers around the plausibility of achieving consistent growth and suitable niches for the potential business. Many commenters acknowledge the potential of the scenario and offer suggestions for niches with growth potential, such as tech, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, concerns are raised about the feasibility of maintaining a 10% growth rate and the challenges of running a business while also paying off an SBA loan. The overall sentiment is divided, with some expressing enthusiasm and others voicing skepticism. The most upvoted comment expresses doubt about the likelihood of consistent growth and advises caution in embarking on this type of entrepreneurship.",
