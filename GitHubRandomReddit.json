    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the potential strike of video game performers who are demanding better pay and working conditions. Many commenters expressed their support for the performers, as they believe their contribution to the industry is undervalued. They argue that without these performers, the games would not have the same level of immersion or storytelling. Concerns were raised about the impact a strike could have on the industry as a whole, with some suggesting that it could lead to the use of non-unionized voice actors or even a decrease in the quality of games. Overall, the majority of commenters are in favor of the performers standing up for their rights, with one of the most upvoted comments stating ?I?m glad they?re standing up for themselves and for future generations of voice actors.?",
