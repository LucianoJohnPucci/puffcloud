Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the author introduces Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" and the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship. Using a hypothetical example, Deibel proposes that an entrepreneur can buy a $1 million business with a $100K investment and a 90% SBA loan, projecting a 10% annual revenue growth over a ten-year period leading to a sale price of $3-4 million. Commenters had mixed reactions to this idea, with some highlighting the potential benefits of acquiring an existing business rather than starting from scratch. They also identified possible industries such as healthcare, technology, or renewable energy that could achieve this growth trajectory. However, others raised concerns about the realistic nature of consistent 10% growth and the potential risks involved in taking on a large loan. The overall sentiment appeared to be cautiously optimistic about acquisition entrepreneurship, emphasizing the importance of thorough research and due diligence. The most upvoted comment warned against basing decisions solely on optimistic projections and urged entrepreneurs to also consider their passion and skills when exploring the option of acquisition.",
