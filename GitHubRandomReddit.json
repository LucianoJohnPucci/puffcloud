    "Title": "The Reddit post, written by a small business owner working over 70 hours a week, sparked a discussion on the notion of small businesses being truly passive. While some commenters acknowledged the potential for efficient systems and delegation to reduce time commitment, there was a general consensus that being a business owner requires at least some level of engagement. The key positive points raised included the importance of focusing on high-leverage tasks and creating an efficient workload. However, main concerns were also expressed, such as the difficulty in finding a balance between delegation and staying involved in the business and the potential for burnout. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters leaned towards the understanding that owning a small business involves a significant time commitment, but it is possible to work smarter and delegate effectively to create more freedom. The top upvoted comment, with 335 upvotes, stated, \"I agree with this ... even with the best systems and delegation, being a business owner requires some level of involvement.\"",
