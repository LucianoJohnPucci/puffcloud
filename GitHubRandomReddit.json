The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, users discuss the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business. Over 21 days and a budget of $100, the campaign generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and 57% conversion rate. The main positive points raised by users include the satisfactory return on ad spend and the indication of immediate buyer intent from most callers. However, concerns were raised about the average of one call every three days and the need for further refinement of keyword targeting and more specific ad groups for the client's four departments. Overall, the sentiment among commenters was optimistic, with a focus on improving the campaign's effectiveness in the future. The top upvoted comment states, \"It's great to see immediate buyer intent, but the low number of calls per day suggests the campaign still needs some tweaking. Refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups should help drive even better results.\"",
