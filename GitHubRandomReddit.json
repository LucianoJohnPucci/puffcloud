    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",
