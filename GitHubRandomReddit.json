    "Title": "This Reddit post chronicles the journey of an author who started their business in 2007, leveraging 22 years of experience and client loyalty. Despite facing challenges such as the 2008 crash and the COVID-19 pandemic, they managed to survive by working from home and avoiding real estate costs, which was seen as a positive decision by many commenters. However, rising costs in 2020 made the business unsustainable, leading the author to consider a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. The main concern raised by commenters was the uncertainty of the future and the potential risk of taking on contract work. However, the overall sentiment was one of support and encouragement, with many acknowledging the author's resilience and determination to keep their business afloat. The comment with the most upvotes reminded the author to prioritize their own well-being and not be too hard on themselves during this difficult time.",
