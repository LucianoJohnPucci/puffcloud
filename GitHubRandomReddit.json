    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The majority of commenters on the Reddit post are expressing frustration and disappointment with the small business's handling of the customer's return. Many point out that the business should have honored their return policy and covered the return shipping cost, especially since the item was not suitable for the customer. Some also mention that the USPS's mistake should not be the customer's responsibility. The overall sentiment is that the business is not living up to their promises and is not treating their customers fairly. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the importance of good customer service and how this situation could have been avoided if the business had communicated better with the customer.",
