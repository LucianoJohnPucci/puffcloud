    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the topic of discussion is the poor advice commonly given to entrepreneurs - that a good product will sell itself. The original poster shares their own experience, prompting others to share similar experiences and the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement. The majority of commenters agree with the need for active promotion and engagement in the marketplace, emphasizing the role of social media, customer interaction, and building a strong brand image. They also touch on the importance of understanding and targeting the right audience, and being adaptable and responsive to feedback. Some concerns raised include the difficulty and cost of promoting on social media, and the potential for oversaturation and burnout. However, the overall sentiment is that while having a good product is important, it is not enough to guarantee success - active and strategic marketing is crucial. The comment with the most upvotes echoes this sentiment, stating \"A good product may get initial attention, but it takes a strong and effective marketing strategy to sustain and grow a business.\"",
