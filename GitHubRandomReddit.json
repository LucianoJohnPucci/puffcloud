The user has $300K cash to allocate but estimates needing $407,750 for the purchase, including a $1.725M offer (10% down), working capital, and advisor fees. Key concerns are the accuracy of their financial calculations and the reasonableness of their offer compared to the seller?s $1.8M reserve. They seek advice on validating their budget and offer, with suggestions to consult financial advisors, compare industry valuations, and engage business brokers for insights.",

While the user has $300k in cash to allocate, there are concerns about the accuracy of their financial calculations and the reasonableness of their offer compared to the seller's $1.8M reserve. Some users suggest seeking the advice of financial advisors and engaging business brokers to validate the budget and offer. The overall sentiment is that this could be a good opportunity, but careful due diligence is necessary. One highly-upvoted comment advises the user to carefully analyze the industry valuations and not be swayed by the seller's reserve price.",
