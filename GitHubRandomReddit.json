    "Title": "The Reddit post regarding a handmade jewelry business seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a chain of small boutiques has generated a lively discussion. Many commenters expressed excitement for the potential opportunity, highlighting the jeweler's unique and high-quality designs as a key selling point. Suggestions were made about creating a minimum order quantity that works for both parties, such as offering different quantities at different profit margins. However, the main concern raised was the potential for the jeweler to lose the handmade aspect of their business by producing high quantities. Some suggested setting a maximum number of units per design to maintain the handmade feel. Overall, the sentiment was positive, with most commenters offering helpful advice and encouragement. One comment in particular stood out with the most upvotes, which suggested negotiating a higher profit margin for the initial order to test the market before committing to larger quantities.",
