    "Title": "In the Reddit post analyzing Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" many commenters express enthusiasm for the simplified mathematical example presented, which outlines the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship through buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE). With a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan, the post suggests that one could grow the business revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. However, some commenters raise valid concerns about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade, citing factors such as market saturation and economic downturns. Others inquired about specific small business niches that would fit this model, with some pointing to industries like healthcare and technology as potential options. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is mostly positive about the potential of acquisition entrepreneurship, but there is also a recognition of the challenges and risks involved. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"Definitely an interesting strategy, but I think it's important to consider the potential risks and variables involved in growing a business consistently over such a long period of time.\"",
