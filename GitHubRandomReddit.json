    "Title": "The Reddit discussion centers around concerns about the power that Stripe, a popular payment processor, holds over small businesses. Many commenters have shared their horror stories of having their funds frozen, being asked for additional documentation, and feeling like they were being held hostage by Stripe. This seems to be a recurring issue, especially when businesses enable Stripe's Risk & Decision Review (RDR) feature. Some positive feedback includes comments about Stripe being reliable and convenient, but the overall sentiment is one of frustration and fear. The most upvoted comment comes from a commenter who had their funds frozen for over a month and was asked for extensive documentation with no explanation or resolution in sight. This raises concerns about the lack of transparency and communication from Stripe, leaving many small businesses feeling vulnerable to their power.",
