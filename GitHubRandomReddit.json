The main positive points mentioned were the need for fair wages and working conditions, and the empowering message of collective action and solidarity in the face of corporate greed. However, concerns were raised about the potential harm to small businesses and job losses for non-striking employees. Some commenters also mentioned the role of unions and government policies in protecting worker rights. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was mostly supportive of the striking workers and critical of the business owners. The most upvoted comment, with over 12,000 upvotes, was the following: \"If people don't stand up for their rights and demand fair treatment, then who will? The business owners only care about their profits, not their employees.\"",
