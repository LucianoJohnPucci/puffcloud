The premise is that if the business grows its revenue by 10% annually, it could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. The reader questions the realism of achieving consistent 10% growth over a decade and seeks insights on small business niches that could realistically fit this scenario.",

    "Title": "In the Reddit post, readers are discussing a hypothetical scenario presented by an entrepreneur who purchased a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in SDE using a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur suggests that if the business were to consistently grow its revenue by 10% annually, it could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. While some readers see potential in this scenario, others express skepticism about the feasibility of achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade. One key positive point mentioned is the potential for a significant return on investment, with the possibility of tripling or quadrupling the initial investment within ten years. However, concerns are raised about the challenges of sustaining consistent growth in the small business market, with commenters pointing to factors such as market saturation, competition, and economic uncertainties. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some praising the entrepreneurial spirit and others cautioning against overly optimistic expectations in the business world. The comment with the most upvotes suggests that the key to achieving sustained growth in this scenario would be to identify a niche market that is both profitable and adaptable to changes in the industry.",
