    "Title": "The post on Reddit highlights the perspective of a small business owner who believes that the idea of \"passive\" small business ownership is misleading. The author acknowledges the importance of hard work but argues that with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, small businesses can become less time-consuming. This idea of \"passive\" ownership is not about complete inactivity but rather effective management through automation and delegation. Many commenters support this notion, stating that businesses can indeed become less time-consuming with the right systems in place.

However, some have raised concerns about the need for constant monitoring and the difficulty in finding the right balance between automation and human input. The overall sentiment of the commenters is supportive of the idea that businesses can become less time-consuming with effective management, but also recognize the potential challenges and complexities involved. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"As a small business owner myself, I fully agree with the concept of 'passive' ownership. It's all about finding the right balance and leveraging technology and delegation to streamline processes.\"",
