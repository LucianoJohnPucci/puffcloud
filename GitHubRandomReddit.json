Before automating, identify pain points, map out workflows, and follow a 9-step process: eliminate, reduce, simplify, optimize, automate, document, delegate, outsource (if not a core competency), and measure. Only after streamlining and optimizing processes should automation be considered, as it is merely an efficiency multiplier of existing processes.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the importance of properly streamlining and optimizing business processes before considering automation. Commenters generally agree with this sentiment, noting that automation should only be used as an efficiency multiplier of existing processes. The 9-step process mentioned in the post - eliminate, reduce, simplify, optimize, automate, document, delegate, outsource, and measure - is seen as a helpful guide for effectively implementing automation. However, concerns are raised about the potential negative effects of automation, such as job loss and diminishing human skills. The overall sentiment is that proper planning and consideration is necessary before implementing automation in order to reap its full benefits. The top-rated comment from user \"abc1233926\" states, \"Automation should always be approached with a strategic and measured mindset. It can be a powerful tool when used correctly, but can also create chaos if rushed into without proper consideration.\"",
