After successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. The customer insisted on net 60 payments, which the owner found untenable due to the upfront costs of custom work. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still risky for the owner. Ultimately, the owner chose not to proceed with the order, prioritizing peace of mind over financial risk. They sought to hear from others about similar experiences with large companies.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed a small UK engineering company facing challenges when dealing with an overseas customer in the UAE. Despite successfully agreeing on specifications for a custom product, issues arose during the onboarding process, with the customer insisting on net 60 payment terms. After negotiating, the best offer was net 30, but the owner found it too risky and decided not to proceed with the order. The post received many responses from others who shared their experiences with large companies and their payment terms. The main positive points highlighted the importance of communication and setting clear expectations before agreeing to any deal. However, the main concern was the power imbalance between small businesses and large corporations, where the former often feels pressured to accept unfavorable terms to secure a deal. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic towards the challenges small businesses face in such situations and the need for fair and transparent business practices. The most upvoted comment was, \"It's unfortunate that small businesses often have to choose between financial stability and peace of mind. It's important to stand by your principles and not succumb to unreasonable demands.\"",
