    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the author discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship from Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario presented is an entrepreneur acquiring a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The target is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. Majority of the commenters view this as a feasible plan, highlighting the low-risk factors and potential for higher returns. They suggest focusing on niches such as renewable energy, healthcare, and technology to achieve this growth rate. However, some concerns were raised regarding the consistency of achieving a 10% growth over the span of a decade, as economic and market factors could affect the business's success. The overall sentiment of the commenters is positive, with many sharing their own experiences and success stories with acquisition entrepreneurship. A top-voted comment by one user states, \"It all comes down to proper planning and execution. With the right mindset and strategies, a 10% annual growth is definitely possible in a decade, maybe even more.\"",
