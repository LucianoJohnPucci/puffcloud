    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the writer's concerns about the increase in Stripe payment processor horror stories, specifically involving small businesses experiencing frozen funds, enhanced due diligence requests, and feeling \"held hostage\". These incidents seem to occur more often when businesses enable Stripe's RDR feature. Many commenters have shared their own positive experiences with Stripe, citing its user-friendly interface and reliable customer service. However, the main concern raised is the power and control payment processors have over small businesses, particularly in the case of fund freezes and RDR requests. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and worry over the potential negative impact on small businesses. The most upvoted comment highlights the need for more transparent communication from payment processors and suggests seeking out alternatives to Stripe.",
