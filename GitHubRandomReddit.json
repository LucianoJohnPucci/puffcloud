    "Title": "This Reddit post sparked a discussion about the factors that contribute to success in entrepreneurship. Many commenters expressed the belief that hard work and strategy are the key components, as they are within one's control. They argued that timing and connections are merely factors of luck and do not guarantee success. Some also shared personal stories of their own hard work leading to entrepreneurial success. However, others expressed concern about the role of privilege and access to resources in achieving success, suggesting that luck may play a bigger role than is often acknowledged. The overall sentiment of the commenters was one of disillusionment and frustration with the reality of entrepreneurship. The most upvoted comment stated, \"Working hard and being strategic is important, but luck and connections can definitely open doors that hard work alone may not.\"",
