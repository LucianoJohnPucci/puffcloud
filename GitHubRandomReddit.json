    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering payment holds and \"enhanced due diligence\". The business owner had a successful and established business with no prior issues, but faced cash flow problems due to the lack of clear communication from Stripe support, who only provided generic responses. Despite some positive experiences with RDR, the key concerns raised include the inconsistency of Stripe's responses and the impact on cash flow for small businesses. Commenters also express dissatisfaction with Stripe's generic and delayed support, with many sharing similar experiences. The overall sentiment is one of frustration and disappointment towards Stripe's handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment highlights the need for effective communication and transparency from Stripe in addressing these issues.",
