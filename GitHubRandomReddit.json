The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

While the campaign indicated a good return on ad spend and immediate buyer intent from most callers, the overall sentiment of the commenters was mixed. Some expressed positive aspects such as a decent ROAS and plans for refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for different departments to improve future effectiveness. However, there were also concerns raised about the low volume of calls, with an average of one call every three days. The top-upvoted comment highlighted the need for further optimization to increase call volume and overall campaign success.",
