    "Title": "The Reddit post discussing a small business owner facing a lawsuit for website inaccessibility under the ADA generated a lot of heated discussion. Many commenters expressed sympathy for the business owner and praised their use of an official Shopify theme and accessible apps. They also highlighted the substantial financial burden and lack of warning faced by the owner, who feels scammed and seeks support and collective action.

The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and outrage towards the legal system and the lack of support for small businesses in navigating ADA compliance. One commenter with the most upvotes states, \"This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by both the government and web providers.
