    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" However, after returning the item and paying $14 for shipping, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The business then refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item for a refund, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. The main positive points raised by commenters include the customer having followed the return policy and the business having a good product and customer service. However, the main concern is the business not honoring its return policy fairly and causing the customer inconvenience and additional expenses. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business should honor their return policy and cover the return shipping cost. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"The business should have specified their return policy more clearly and should take responsibility for the return shipping cost since it was not the customer's fault.\"",
