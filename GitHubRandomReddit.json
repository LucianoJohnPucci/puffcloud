    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship as presented in Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario outlined involves buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200K SDE using a $100K personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The potential for 10% annual revenue growth and a future sale for $3-4M in ten years is intriguing, but some commenters have questioned the feasibility of consistent growth over such a long period of time. They also seek insights into specific small business niches that might fit this growth model.
