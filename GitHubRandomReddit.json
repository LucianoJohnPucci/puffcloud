    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's experience with a small business's return policy. The business advertised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after the customer returned their $50 item and paid $14 for shipping, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The main positive points raised by commenters include the importance of reading and understanding return policies, the business's right to enforce their policy, and the potential for the customer to escalate the issue through a chargeback. Key concerns revolve around the fairness of the return policy and the additional costs incurred by the customer, with some commenters empathizing with the customer's frustration and others defending the business's actions. The overall sentiment of the commenters leans towards dissatisfaction with the business's handling of the situation. The top-voted comment states, \"Businesses need to be transparent and fair with their return policies, or they risk losing customers and damaging their reputation.\"",
