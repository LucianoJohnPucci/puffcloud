The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days and resulted in 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. Most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent, and 4 out of the 7 calls led to jobs booked. While the overall results were satisfactory, there were concerns about the frequency of calls and plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's four departments. This was met with a generally positive sentiment from commenters, with some highlighting the decent return on ad spend and the effectiveness of targeting buyers with immediate needs. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"It's great to see the campaign generating quality leads, but it would be worth looking into ways to increase the frequency of calls for a more consistent stream of business.\"",
