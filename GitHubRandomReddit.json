    "Title": "The Reddit post focuses on an entrepreneur who joined a fast growth and investor funding group, but prefers stable growth and self-funding for their business. They shared their approach but were criticized for not working enough. However, the author values work-life balance and aims to build a business that supports their desired lifestyle. While they were hurt by the criticism, they are determined to continue their business journey without the support of the group. Commenters mostly acknowledged the importance of work-life balance and suggested that the author should stick to their goals and not worry about external validation. Many highlighted the benefits of self-funding and slow, steady growth in contrast to seeking investor funding. The main concerns raised were the possibility of burnout and the author's determination to continue without the support of the group. Overall, the sentiment among commenters was supportive and understanding of the author's values and goals. One comment with the most upvotes reads, \"Kudos to you for sticking to your values and prioritizing work-life balance in your business. Don't let others' judgments discourage you, success looks different for everyone.\"",
