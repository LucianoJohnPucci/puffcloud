    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed a commonly given but flawed piece of advice that \"a good product will sell itself\", calling for entrepreneurs to share their experiences and debunk this belief. The majority of commenters agreed that while having a good product is essential, effective marketing and online engagement are crucial for success. Points such as identifying target markets, building a strong online presence, and creating a buzz through word-of-mouth were highlighted as important strategies. Concerns raised included the misconception that a good product alone will guarantee success, as well as the need for entrepreneurs to constantly adapt and evolve their marketing strategies. The overall sentiment was that while having a good product is a great starting point, it is not enough to ensure success in the competitive market. The most upvoted comment eloquently stated, \"In today's world, even the best product needs an effective marketing strategy to stand out and reach its target audience.\" Through this discussion, it is evident that the idea of a good product selling itself is a harmful misconception, and entrepreneurs must prioritize effective marketing to achieve success.",
