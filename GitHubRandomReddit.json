To convert from hex to binary, each hex digit must be converted into its corresponding 4-bit binary representation.\n\nHere is the conversion table for converting from hex to binary:\n\nHex \tBinary\n0 \t\t0000\n1 \t\t0001\n2 \t\t0010\n3 \t\t0011\n4 \t\t0100\n5 \t\t0101\n6 \t\t0110\n7 \t\t0111\n8 \t\t1000\n9 \t\t1001\nA \t\t1010\nB \t\t1011\nC \t\t1100\nD \t\t1101\nE \t\t1110\nF \t\t1111\n\nTo convert a hex number to binary, simply replace each hex digit with its corresponding binary representation from the table above. For example, to convert the hex number 3F, we would replace the letter \"3\" with 0011 and the letter \"F\" with 1111, resulting in the binary number 00111111.<|endoftext|>Hard Contact\n\nHard contact lenses, also known as rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, are a type of contact lens made from a harder and less flexible material than soft contact lenses. They are designed to provide clear vision by sitting directly on the cornea, the front surface of the eye. Unlike soft contact lenses, which conform to the shape of the eye, hard contact lenses maintain their shape and allow oxygen to flow through them to reach the cornea.\n\nHard contact lenses are often recommended for people with certain eye conditions, such as astigmatism, keratoconus, and extreme nearsightedness or farsightedness. They can also be used for people who have had corneal refractive surgery, as they can provide better visual acuity and stability.\n\nHowever, hard contact lenses may take longer to get used to compared to soft contact lenses",
