    "Title": "The post on Reddit discusses the recent increase in import duties and processing fees by UPS and DHL, leading to additional costs of $20 to $50 per shipment and impacting both US shoppers and small business owners. Many commenters express frustration and concern about the added expenses, with some saying they have decided to halt US orders due to the high fees. However, some commenters point out that the fees are necessary to cover the rising costs of shipping and customs, and that these companies are just trying to stay profitable. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some understanding the reasoning behind the fees while others are strongly against it. The comment with the most upvotes acknowledges the frustration, but also reminds everyone that shipping and customs are complex issues and it is important to consider all perspectives before passing judgement.",
