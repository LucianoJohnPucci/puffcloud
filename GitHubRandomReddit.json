The majority of commenters express support for the author's idea and emphasize the need for transparency in online marketing. Many point out that astroturfing not only deceives consumers but also creates an unfair advantage for these businesses. Some concerns raised include potential legal and ethical implications for the author's planned website and the difficulty of identifying and reporting astroturfing in the first place.
