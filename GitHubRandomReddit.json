    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds, despite having a successful and established business with no previous issues. The main positive points highlighted by commenters include the effectiveness of RDR in quickly resolving disputes, as well as the importance of enhanced due diligence in protecting businesses and customers from fraud. However, the main concern raised is the lack of clear communication from Stripe's support team, leading to cash flow problems for the business owner. Commenters express frustration and disappointment in Stripe's generic responses, with one user even calling it a \"lack of respect\" for their customers. The overall sentiment of the commenters is negative towards Stripe's handling of this situation, with many sharing similar experiences and expressing a loss of trust in the company. The comment with the most upvotes calls for better communication and support from Stripe, stating that \"communication and transparency are key in building and maintaining trust.\"",
