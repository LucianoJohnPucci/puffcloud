    "Title": "This Reddit post centers around a handmade jewelry business seeking advice from the community on negotiating a profit margin with a chain of small boutiques interested in carrying their products. The key positive points raised by commenters include the potential for increased exposure and sales through the boutiques' multiple locations, as well as the opportunity for the jeweler to scale up their production. However, main concerns were raised regarding the potential for the jewelry to lose its handmade and exclusive appeal if produced in high quantities, as well as the potential for the profit margin to be too low or not worth the effort. The overall sentiment of commenters was one of caution and thoughtful consideration of both the pros and cons of the opportunity, as well as a shared understanding of the jeweler's dilemma as they navigate this new situation. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"I think it's important for the jeweler to carefully calculate their costs and determine a minimum profit margin they are comfortable with before negotiating with the boutique owner.\"",
