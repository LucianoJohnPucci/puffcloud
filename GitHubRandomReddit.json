    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship as outlined in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario presented involves an entrepreneur buying a $1M business, investing $100k, and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan, with the goal of growing revenue by 10% annually and selling for $3-4M in ten years. While some commenters agree that this is a viable strategy, others express concern about the feasibility and sustainability of achieving a consistent 10% growth rate over a decade. Some suggest that it depends on the industry and niche of the business, citing technology, healthcare, and food as potential sectors that could support such growth. The overall sentiment seems to be cautiously optimistic, with a mix of success stories and cautionary tales shared. The most upvoted comment warns against over-optimism and recommends thoroughly researching the market and industry before making such a significant investment.",
