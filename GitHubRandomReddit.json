    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the potential sale of a small business app for $2 million. The key positive points raised by commenters include the app's current profitability and potential for growth, the potential for the owner to make a significant profit, and the possibility for successful partnerships or acquisition offers. Some concerns were raised about the app's sustainability without the current owner's involvement, the potential for a higher sales price, and finding a buyer who aligns with the owner?s values. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was mostly positive, with many congratulating the owner and offering advice on negotiating the sale.
