    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the writer's concerns about the apparent increase in Stripe payment processor horror stories, specifically involving small businesses having their funds frozen, being asked for enhanced due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\". The writer has noticed a spike in such incidents, especially when using Stripe's RDR feature, and is worried about the power that payment processors hold over small businesses. However, some commenters have shared positive experiences with Stripe, praising its ease of use and security measures such as fraud detection. Many are also critical of the writer's view, arguing that these issues are not unique to Stripe and that merchants need to follow proper regulations and standards to avoid such problems. The main concerns raised by commenters include the lack of transparency and communication from Stripe, the potential for abuse of power by payment processors, and the difficulty for small businesses to switch to alternative processors. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some expressing frustration and anger towards Stripe, while others defend the company and its practices. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the need for more regulation and oversight in the payment processing industry.",
