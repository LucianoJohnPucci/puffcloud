However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

The majority of commenters expressed frustration and disappointment with the business for not honoring their return policy fairly. Many highlighted the inconvenience and financial burden placed on the customer and suggested that the business should take responsibility for the return shipping costs.
