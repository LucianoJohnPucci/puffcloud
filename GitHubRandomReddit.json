However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shares their frustration with a small business after returning a $50 item that did not meet their expectations. The business had advertised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after the item was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender, the customer was required to pay an additional $14 for return shipping. The main positive points raised by commenters include their appreciation for the return policy initially offered by the business and their understanding of the challenges small businesses face. However, the main concern raised is the business's refusal to cover the cost of return shipping and insisting on receiving the item before issuing a refund, which some commenters feel is unfair and unreasonable. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and disappointment, with many understanding the customer's desire to initiate a chargeback. The most upvoted comment suggests that the business should have a clear policy in place for situations like this and should prioritize customer satisfaction over a few dollars in shipping costs.",
