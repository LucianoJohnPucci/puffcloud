    "Link": "A small business owner with over a decade of experience is struggling with declining sales this year, largely due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit thread, a small business owner with extensive experience is facing a decline in sales due to high shipping costs. The owner has surveyed abandoned cart customers and found that 90% of them were deterred by shipping prices. The business primarily uses FedEx for shipping, but has been unable to obtain any discounts from UPS. Previous attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that did not improve sales. The owner has received offers from Unishippers, but the company is deemed untrustworthy. Many commenters offered helpful advice, such as seeking quotes from other shipping companies and exploring different packaging options to reduce the size of packages. However, the main concern raised by the commenters was the lack of discounts available from UPS. The overall sentiment from the commenters was frustration and empathy for the business owner's struggles. The comment with the most upvotes suggested seeking advice from other business owners who have successfully negotiated better shipping rates with UPS.",
