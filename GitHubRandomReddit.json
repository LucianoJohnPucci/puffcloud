    "Title": "In a Reddit discussion about a small business owner's decision to change to part-time work, the author is praised for their 22 years of experience and client loyalty that enabled them to survive the 2008 crash.  Additionally, working from home was seen as a smart move that reduced real estate costs.

The overall sentiment among commenters is sympathetic to the author's difficult decision, recognizing the tough circumstances faced by small business owners. The comment with the most upvotes expressed solidarity and support for the author, stating, \"As a fellow self-employed person, I totally understand the struggle. I hope things work out for you!\"",
