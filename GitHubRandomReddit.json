    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a frustrating experience that a customer had with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but when they returned it, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Many commenters praised the customer for attempting to return the item within the specified time frame and criticized the business for not honoring their return policy fairly. Others suggested that the business should have covered the return shipping cost or accepted a photo of the unclaimed package as proof. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic towards the customer and critical of the business's handling of the situation. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"If a customer is making an effort to return an item within the specified time frame, the business should make an effort to honor their return policy and not put the customer through additional expenses.\"",
