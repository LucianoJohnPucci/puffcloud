    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author is discussing the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship as outlined in \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel. The scenario presented is that of an entrepreneur purchasing a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and eventually sell it for $3-4M in ten years. Many commenters applaud the strategy of using an SBA loan and emphasize the importance of having a solid business plan and market research before making any acquisitions. Some also suggest niches such as technology or healthcare that could potentially support consistent growth. However, others express concerns about the feasibility of achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade and advise against relying too heavily on projections. The overall sentiment of the commenters is cautiously optimistic, with many acknowledging the potential for success but also emphasizing the need for caution and careful planning. The most upvoted comment states, \"It's definitely possible, but it takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and a bit of luck.\"",
