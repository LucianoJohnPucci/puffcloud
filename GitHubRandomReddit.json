    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds, causing cash flow issues. Despite the owner having a successful and established business with no issues, Stripe's support only provided generic responses and lacked clear communication. Many commenters expressed similar experiences, with some highlighting the positive aspects of Stripe's service, such as its user-friendly platform, simplified payment process, and fraud detection capabilities. However, the main concerns raised were the lack of transparency and limited customer support, with some claiming that Stripe's RDR feature is too sensitive and causes unnecessary complications for legitimate businesses. The overall sentiment of the commenters is frustration and disappointment with Stripe's support and communication, with some suggesting alternatives such as PayPal and Square. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"Stripe's automated system is causing more harm than good for legitimate businesses. We need clear and transparent communication from their support team.\"",
