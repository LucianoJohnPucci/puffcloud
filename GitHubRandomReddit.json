One user mentions that the construction and tradespeople industries seem to be doing better recently, with some attributing this growth to the housing market boom and government stimulus packages. Other industries mentioned include eCommerce, technology, and delivery services, which have also seen an increase in demand due to the pandemic.

There is a sense of caution and uncertainty among the commenters, with some expressing a need for more government support and others acknowledging the resilience and adaptability of small businesses. Overall, the sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic, with one user's comment earning the most upvotes by stating, \"Small businesses have always been the backbone of our economy.
