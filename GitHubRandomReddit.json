    "Title": "The Reddit post revolves around an author who has recently been hired by a family-owned organic grocer and is frustrated with the lack of understanding and support from management towards social media as a marketing tool. While the author has an advertising background, all drafted social media posts have been rejected and the owners view social media as a casual platform instead of a strategic asset. Due to the challenges faced in outside sales and feeling intimidated by management dynamics, the author seeks advice from peers on how to effectively communicate the value of social media without being overbearing or condescending.\n\nThe key positive points raised by commenters include the author's valuable expertise in the field of advertising and the potential benefits of using social media to boost the visibility and sales of the family-owned grocer. However, the main concerns voiced by commenters revolve around the management's lack of understanding and support for social media, and the author's difficulty in effectively communicating the importance of social media without overstepping or appearing condescending. The overall sentiment of commenters is one of support for the author and frustration towards the management's dismissal of social media as a valuable marketing tool.\n\nThe comment with the most upvotes highlights the frustration of many commenters and the overall sentiment of the discussion: \"I've been in a similar situation and it's incredibly frustrating when management doesn't see the value in utilizing social media for marketing. Keep pushing and presenting the potential benefits, but also don't let it consume you. In the end, it's their business and their decision.\"",
