The overall sentiment among commenters was divided, with some advocating for termination and others urging caution and thorough evaluation. The most upvoted comment stated, \"It's important to consider all factors before making a decision to terminate a customer, but ultimately, the customer's behavior and impact on others should be the deciding factor.\"",
