    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post sparked a discussion about a customer's negative experience with a small business and their return policy. The general consensus among commenters was that the business was not handling the situation fairly and should honor their return policy by covering the return shipping costs. Some key positive points were raised, with some commenters acknowledging that it is common for small businesses to have limited resources and may not be able to absorb the cost of return shipping. However, the main concerns raised were that the business was not being transparent about their return policy and that the customer was facing an additional financial burden due to the business's refusal to cover the return shipping costs. The overall sentiment of the commenters was frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"A return policy is only as good as the business's willingness to actually honor it. By refusing to pay for the return shipping and insisting on receiving the item back, this business is not meeting their own promises of '100% satisfaction guarantee'.\"",
