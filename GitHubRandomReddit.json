    "Title": "This Reddit post is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin between a handmade jewelry business and a chain of small boutiques interested in carrying their products. The post received a mix of positive and negative responses, with most commenters providing suggestions and insights on how to handle this opportunity. Some key positive points raised include the potential for increased exposure and sales, as well as the opportunity to establish a relationship with the boutique owner. However, many commenters also expressed concerns about the feasibility of meeting the boutique owner's minimum requirement of 50 units per design, as the jewelry business may not have the resources or experience to produce high quantities. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be that this could be a great opportunity for the jewelry business, but caution and thorough consideration should be taken before making any decisions. The comment with the most upvotes recommended the jeweler to carefully assess their production capabilities and costs before entering into any negotiations.",
