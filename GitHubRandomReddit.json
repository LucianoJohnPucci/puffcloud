    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, as presented in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario presented is of an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with $200k SDE and investing $100k while financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to achieve a 10% annual growth rate for ten years and ultimately sell the business for $3-4M. Some commenters express positive sentiments towards this strategy, citing the potential for a high return on investment and the low initial cost required. However, there are concerns about the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade and the potential challenges of managing a business bought through acquisition. There is also discussion around specific niches that may support this growth, such as technology or healthcare. The overall sentiment of the commenters is cautious optimism, with many acknowledging the potential benefits but also highlighting the potential risks and challenges. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of researching and understanding the industry and market before jumping into acquisition entrepreneurship.",
