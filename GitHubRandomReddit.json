    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author is exploring the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship as presented in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario discussed involves an entrepreneur purchasing a $1M business with a $200k SDE, investing $100k, and using a 90% SBA loan to finance the rest. The plan is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The main positive points raised by commenters include the possibility of achieving a high return on investment and the benefits of taking a calculated risk in the business world. However, many expressed concerns about the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade and the potential challenges of securing an SBA loan. The overall sentiment of commenters was mixed, with some expressing excitement about the potential success of the plan and others cautioning against relying on such a specific growth rate. The comment with the most upvotes was a reminder to consider the importance of market research and finding a niche with strong growth potential.",
