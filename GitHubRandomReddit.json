    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, resulting in a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The campaign was deemed satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS) and a indication of buyer intent from the majority of callers having immediate needs. However, the frequency of calls (only one every three days) was seen as a concern and future plans to improve the campaign's effectiveness include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's different departments. The overall sentiment of the commenters is positive, with many acknowledging the satisfactory results and offering suggestions for improvement. The top upvoted comment suggests implementing call tracking to better understand the source of the calls and optimize the campaign.",
