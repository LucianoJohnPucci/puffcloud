    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The majority of commenters on the Reddit post expressed frustration with the small business in question for not honoring their return policy, which promised a full refund and free return shipping within 30 days. Many stated that the business should have covered the cost of return shipping, as it was their responsibility to ensure the item was delivered back to them. Some also mentioned that the business could have provided a prepaid shipping label to avoid any additional costs for the customer. However, there were some who pointed out that USPS was also at fault for marking the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that the customer had a valid reason to be frustrated and considering a chargeback. The top comment, with the most upvotes, stated, \"If they claim to have a 30-day return policy, then they should honor it without making the customer pay for shipping. It's not the customer's fault that USPS couldn't deliver the package.\"",
