The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign revealed a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs booked. While the results were satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), some were concerned about the low frequency of calls, with only one call every three days on average. However, the campaign did show that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. Suggestions were made to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's departments to improve effectiveness. Overall, commenters were optimistic about the campaign's potential with targeted improvements. The most upvoted comment stated, \"Great to see positive ROI and potential for even better results with targeted ad groups. Keep up the good work!\"",
