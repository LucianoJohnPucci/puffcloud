    "Title": "In a recent Reddit discussion on r/WorkersStrikeBack, users gathered to discuss the ongoing labor strike and its impact on small businesses. Overall, the sentiment seems to be supportive of the strikers and their demands for fair wages and working conditions. Many commenters applaud the workers for standing up for their rights and highlight the importance of valuing employees and their contributions. However, there are concerns raised about the potential financial strain on small businesses due to the strike. Some discuss alternative solutions such as implementing a gradual wage increase or providing additional benefits to workers. One user's comment with the most upvotes highlights the importance of seeing workers as people and not just cogs in a machine, \"When you treat employees as disposable, you lose continuity, loyalty, and intelligent, 'ownership' over decision-making processes.\"",
