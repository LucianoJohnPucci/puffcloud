    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the common misconception that a good product will sell itself and asks for experiences and advice from fellow entrepreneurs. Many commenters agree that effective marketing and online engagement are crucial for the success of a product, and note that even the best products need to be promoted to reach their target audience. Concerns are raised about the danger of relying solely on the quality of a product and neglecting marketing efforts, as well as the importance of balancing both aspects in order to stand out in a crowded market.
