    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a sole proprietor of a marketing agency who has transitioned to an S-Corp to save on self-employment taxes. A disagreement has arisen between their bookkeeper and CPA regarding how to classify subcontractor costs on the 1120S form. The CPA suggests categorizing them as \"Other Deductibles\" while the bookkeeper argues for classifying them as Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS), citing a clearer picture of business expenses and reduced audit risk. The owner is leaning towards the bookkeeper's perspective but seeks additional opinions. Many commenters agreed with the bookkeeper's point, stating that CoGS is a more appropriate classification for subcontractor costs as it directly relates to the production of goods and services. Some raised concerns about potential consequences of listing subcontractor costs as \"Other Deductibles,\" such as increased audit risk and potential issues with the IRS. The general sentiment among commenters was in support of the bookkeeper's argument, with the top upvoted comment stating, \"CoGS would give the most accurate representation of the expenses and also reduce audit risk. I agree with the bookkeeper.\"",
