Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "The concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, as introduced by Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" garners much discussion on a Reddit post. In the book, Deibel presents a hypothetical example of an entrepreneur buying a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan, projecting a 10% annual revenue growth and a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. Many commenters see potential in this strategy, noting its ability to leverage existing business assets and generate significant profit in a relatively short timeline. However, concerns are raised about the feasibility of achieving and maintaining consistent 10% growth, with some commenters questioning the assumed stability of the current business landscape. The overall sentiment of the commenters leans towards cautious optimism, with a recognition of the potential in acquisition entrepreneurship, but also a sense of realism and caution in its execution. The top voted comment highlights the importance of thoroughly researching and understanding the industry and market before embarking on such a venture.",
