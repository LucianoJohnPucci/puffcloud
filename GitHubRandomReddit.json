The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

Most callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. While the campaign yielded satisfactory results with a decent return on ad spend, it averaged only one call every three days. Plans to improve the campaign include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. Commenters praised the high conversion rate and strong buyer intent, but raised concerns about the low number of calls and suggested strategies for improvement, such as targeting specific locations and using negative keywords. The overall sentiment was positive, with commenters expressing satisfaction with the campaign's effectiveness and potential for improvement. The top comment, with the most upvotes, suggested utilizing website tracking to measure the impact of the calls on job bookings.",
