    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post highlights a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after paying $14 for shipping, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. Despite the business's return policy, they refused to cover the return shipping costs and insisted on receiving the item back before issuing a refund, leaving the customer with an additional $14 expense. Some commenters praised the business for having a clear return policy, while others expressed frustration and disappointment in their handling of the situation. One of the top upvoted comments stated, \"It's not fair to expect the customer to pay for shipping twice when the business's error caused the package to be returned.\" Overall, sentiment seems to be that the business should honor their return policy and reimburse the customer for the return shipping costs.",
