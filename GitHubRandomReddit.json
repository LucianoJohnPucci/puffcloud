    "Title": "The Reddit post in question is written by a small business owner who challenges the idea of a \"passive\" small business. While acknowledging the potential for effective systems and delegation to reduce workload, the author emphasizes the need for focus on high-leverage tasks and automation. Several commenters agree with this perspective, noting that being a successful business owner requires hard work and active management.
