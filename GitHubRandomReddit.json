    "Title": "The Reddit post in r/WorkersStrikeBack revolves around the ongoing struggles faced by small businesses during the pandemic. Many commenters express empathy for small business owners and highlight the positive impact of government support, such as PPP loans and unemployment benefits, in keeping these businesses afloat. However, others raise concerns about the small businesses that were excluded from government aid and the potential for large corporations to exploit the situation. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and anger towards the government's handling of the pandemic and support for workers and small businesses. The top-rated comment with over 20,000 upvotes addresses both sides, acknowledging the difficult decisions small business owners have had to make while calling for systematic changes to support workers and small businesses.",
