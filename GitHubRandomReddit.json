    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author shares their interest in the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship outlined in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario presented involves acquiring a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan, with the goal of achieving a 10% annual growth rate and selling the business for $3-4M in ten years. Commenters have offered positive insights on the potential success of this approach, citing real-life examples and emphasizing the importance of careful research and due diligence.

Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment is generally supportive and encouraging, with most commenters highlighting the potential rewards of acquiring and growing a business. The most upvoted comment points out that the success of this strategy largely depends on the chosen niche and the entrepreneur's determination and adaptability.",
