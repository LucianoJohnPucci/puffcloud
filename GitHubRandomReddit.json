However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This post on Reddit discusses the frustration of a customer who ordered a $50 item from a small business with a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but was faced with additional costs when the package was returned to the sender by USPS. Many commenters praised the business for their policies and noted that the customer should have made more effort to ensure delivery. However, others expressed concerns about the additional costs and inconvenience faced by the customer, and questioned the business's refusal to cover return shipping or process the refund without receiving the item first. Overall, the sentiment was mixed, with some commenters sympathizing with the customer and others defending the business's actions. The comment with the most upvotes was one that suggested the business should have a clearer and more transparent return policy.",
