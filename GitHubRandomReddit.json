However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

Many users praised the business for having a generous return policy and expressed sympathy for the customer's situation. However, the main concern raised was the business's refusal to cover the return shipping costs, which resulted in the customer facing an additional $14 charge. Some users argued that the business should honor their policy and cover the cost of return shipping, while others felt that the customer should have been more diligent in ensuring a successful delivery. The overall sentiment of the commenters was one of frustration and disappointment in the business's handling of the situation. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"I don't understand why the business won't just provide a refund without receiving the item. It's not fair to expect the customer to pay for return shipping when they've already paid for shipping to receive the item in the first place.\"",
