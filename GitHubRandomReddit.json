    "Title": "The author of the Reddit post shared their experience of starting a successful business in 2007 after 18 years at a failing company. They highlighted how they leveraged their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to work from home and survive the 2008 crash. Despite their resilience, the author and their husband, who are both self-employed, faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising costs, reported to have increased by 50% in 2020, have made the business unsustainable. In response to this, the author is considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. While many commenters praised the author for their resilience, some raised concerns about the uncertain future of small businesses in light of the pandemic. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic and supportive, with many commending the author for their hard work and determination. One comment in particular received the most upvotes, praising the author for their ability to adapt and survive despite the challenges they faced.",
