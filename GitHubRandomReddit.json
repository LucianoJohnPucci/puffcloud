    "Title": "In a Reddit post reflecting on their experience running an online business for a year, the author expresses a sense of surrealism as they earn more money overnight from automation than in two weeks at their previous job. The post garnered a mix of responses from fellow Redditors, with some highlighting the positives of making passive income and others voicing concerns about the fairness of the system. Many commenters were impressed by the author's success and encouraged them to continue exploring opportunities in automation and entrepreneurship. However, a significant portion of the discussion focused on the disparity between the author's experience and that of their friends who work traditional 9-5 jobs. This raised concerns about the ethical and societal implications of automation and the potential for income inequality. The overall sentiment from the commenters was one of admiration for the author's success, but also a recognition of the need for a more equitable distribution of opportunities. The comment with the most upvotes was one that questioned the sustainability of the author's success and urged them to use their resources to create positive change for their friends and society as a whole.",
