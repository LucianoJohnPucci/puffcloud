    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a customer's frustration with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after returning the item, USPS marked it as unclaimed and returned it to the sender. The business refused to pay for return shipping and only offered a refund after receiving the item back, resulting in additional costs for the customer. The main concerns raised by commenters revolve around the fairness and effectiveness of the business's return policy, with many feeling that the business is not standing by their guarantee and causing inconvenience and financial burden for the customer. The overall sentiment is one of disappointment and annoyance towards the business, with some commenters suggesting the customer file a chargeback if the issue is not resolved. The top-rated comment with the most upvotes is: \"It's absolutely ridiculous that the business won't cover the return shipping cost when they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. They are not honoring their own policy and it's unfair to the customer.\"",
