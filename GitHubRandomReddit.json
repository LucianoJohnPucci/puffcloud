    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the concept of \"passive\" small business ownership and whether it is attainable or even realistic. The author, a small business owner themselves, acknowledges the importance of hard work but argues that with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, businesses can become less time-consuming through automation and delegation. Many commenters agree and share their own success stories of implementing these strategies, highlighting the positive impact it has had on their businesses. However, some raise concerns about the initial investments and resources needed to set up these systems, as well as the ongoing maintenance and potential lack of control if delegating tasks. Overall, the general sentiment is that while passive small business ownership is possible, it requires a lot of effort and careful planning. The top upvoted comment states, \"Automation and delegation definitely help, but it's important to remember that it's not a completely hands-off approach. It still requires active monitoring and management.\"",
