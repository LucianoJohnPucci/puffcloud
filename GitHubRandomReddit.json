    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the approach of a user towards managing finances for their business, including maintaining a separate business checking/savings account and credit card, with a gross profit of 25%. Several users praised this strategy, highlighting the benefits of having a clear separation between personal and business finances. There were also discussions about the uncertainty of how frequently to pay oneself, with some recommending a monthly or quarterly schedule. However, one major concern raised was the lack of concrete financial plans before launching the business. The overall sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many sharing their own experiences and giving book recommendations such as \"Profit First\" and \"The 4-Hour Workweek.\" The comment that garnered the most upvotes was from a user who advised the OP to focus on generating consistent revenue before deciding on a specific pay schedule.",
