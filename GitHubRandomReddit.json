    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author shares their experience of starting a business in 2007 after 18 years at a failing company. They were able to leverage their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to build their business from home, avoiding real estate costs. Despite surviving the 2008 crash, the author and their husband, both self-employed, found their business unsustainable due to rising costs (up 50% in 2020). They are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor, acknowledging their luck in not being forced to close in 2020 like many other small businesses. The key positive points highlighted by the commenters include the author's perseverance in building their business, their strategic decision to work from home, and their ability to survive the 2008 crash. However, the main concerns raised revolve around the continuously increasing costs and the potential risks associated with relying on a single long-term vendor. The overall sentiment of the commenters is sympathetic towards the author, with many sharing their own experiences and offering advice and words of support. The most upvoted comment reminds the author to prioritize their mental and physical health while making difficult decisions for their business.",
