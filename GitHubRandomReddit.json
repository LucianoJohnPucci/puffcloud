    "Title": "The Reddit post reflects on the author's experience running an online business for a year, where they express a sense of surrealism as their automated systems generate more money overnight than what they could make in two weeks at their previous job. Despite feeling a mix of satisfaction and discomfort, they question the fairness of the system and the disparity it creates between them and their friends, who work traditional 9-5 jobs.
