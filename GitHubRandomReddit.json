    "Title": "The small business owner of everm?e, a digital locket product, has requested feedback on their website and product presentation as they have only made 2 sales despite 2,500 website visitors. Their target market is primarily the US and Canada and they struggle with promoting the unfamiliar product and converting clicks into sales. Some key positive points mentioned by commenters are the unique idea and design of the product, as well as the option to create your own personalized locket. However, main concerns raised include the lack of clear information on the website about the product's features and benefits, as well as the need for improvement in customer communication and promotion efforts. The overall sentiment of commenters is that the product has potential, but the online offering and marketing strategy need improvement. The comment with the most upvotes suggests collaborating with small influencers and offering discount codes to increase brand awareness and sales.",
