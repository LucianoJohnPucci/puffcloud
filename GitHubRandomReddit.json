After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy.

    "Title": "This Reddit post features a small business owner who is facing declining sales due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, it was found that shipping prices were a major deterrent to completing purchases. The business primarily ships via FedEx, which offers no discounts for packages over a cubic foot. Despite attempts to lower shipping costs, this resulted in losses and ultimately led to price increases, which did not improve sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers, but has found them to be untrustworthy. Commenters offered advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS, with some suggesting negotiating directly with the companies or using a shipping broker. However, concerns were also raised about the potential risk and complications involved in switching shipping carriers. The overall sentiment from commenters was sympathetic and supportive of the business owner's struggles, with many offering their own experiences and advice. The top upvoted comment, with 281 upvotes, highlighted the importance of researching and calculating the true cost of each shipping option before making any decisions.",
