    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the misconception that a good product will sell itself, and how this advice can be detrimental to entrepreneurs. Commenters agree that while having a great product is important, effective marketing strategies and online engagement are essential for success. They emphasize the need for entrepreneurs to actively promote and engage with their audience, rather than relying solely on the quality of their product. Concerns raised include the oversaturation of the market, the importance of standing out and being adaptable, and the role of word-of-mouth and customer reviews in driving sales.
