The customer requested a custom product with payment terms of net 60, which the owner found difficult to fulfill due to upfront costs.

Commenters shared similar experiences with large companies and expressed concern over the payment terms and risks involved. However, some positive points were also raised, such as the importance of communication and establishing clear terms from the beginning. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic towards the owner and many advised seeking legal protection and diversifying the customer base.
