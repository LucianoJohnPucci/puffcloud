    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the author discusses \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel and the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship. The book presents a scenario where a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200k in seller's discretionary earnings (SDE) can be acquired with a $100k investment and 90% SBA loan. The discussion revolves around the author's doubts about the feasibility of consistently achieving 10% annual revenue growth over ten years and requests insights on profitable niches for small businesses. Some key positive points highlighted by the commenters include the potential for strategic acquisitions, the availability of SBA loans, and the low risk for investment. However, main concerns raised include the challenges of sustaining growth, competition in potential niches, and the possibility of overestimating revenue projections. The overall sentiment of the comments is skeptical, with many pointing out the need for thorough market research and a solid business plan before pursuing such a venture. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of realistic financial projections and advises caution in relying solely on the book's example.",
