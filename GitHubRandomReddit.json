The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post detailed a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days, resulting in 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign had a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs being booked. The main positive points mentioned by commenters were the satisfactory results and decent return on ad spend (ROAS), as well as the indication of buyer intent from the fact that most callers had immediate needs. However, some raised concerns about the low frequency of calls (one call every three days) and suggested refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve effectiveness. The overall sentiment of commenters was positive, with many offering advice and tips to improve the campaign. The comment with the most upvotes suggested targeting potential customers who searched for \"signs\" rather than just \"local sign business.\" Overall, the campaign showed potential for success with some fine-tuning.",
