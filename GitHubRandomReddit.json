    "Title": "This Reddit post features a small business owner challenging the idea that running a successful business can be \"passive.\" While they acknowledge that with the right strategies and experience, it is possible to reduce workload through automation and delegation, they stress that significant effort is still required. The discussion highlights the importance of having a strong work ethic and the ability to prioritize high-leverage tasks in order to succeed. Some commenters also mention the challenges of finding time for personal life and the potential risks of relying too heavily on automation. However, the general sentiment is that owning a small business is a rewarding but demanding endeavor that requires a balance of hard work and smart decision-making. The most upvoted comment echoes this sentiment, stating, \"Being a small business owner means the highs are high and the lows are low. It's a constant grind, but it's worth it.\"",
