    "Title": "The Reddit post in question presents a decision that the poster is facing about whether or not to sell their app for $2 million while it is currently still in its early stages of development. The majority of the commenters agree that selling the app at this stage would be a smart risk-free move, with one commenter stating that the offer is too good to pass up. However, some express concerns about giving up potential future profits and the possibility of not being successful in a future venture. Overall, the sentiment is in favor of selling the app, with the most upvoted comment being \"Take the offer and run, you can always create something bigger and better in the future.\"",
