    "Title": "This Reddit post features a small business owner who sells clothes and shoes on Instagram and has recently found a supplier who has contacted them directly. The owner has requested exclusivity in their region, but has come to find out that the supplier is also messaging their competitors. The owner is seeking advice on how to convince the supplier to only sell to them. The comments in this thread are largely positive, with many pointing out that it is common for suppliers to sell to multiple businesses and that exclusivity may be difficult to attain. Some suggest offering a long-term commitment or building a strong relationship with the supplier as potential solutions. The main concern raised by commenters is the lack of control in this situation and the potential for the supplier to continue selling to competitors despite promises of exclusivity. The overall sentiment among commenters is that while exclusivity may be desirable, it is not always practical or realistic in the business world. The comment with the most upvotes suggests negotiating with the supplier and not entering into any binding contracts without thoroughly researching the company first.",
