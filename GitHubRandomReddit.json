Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the author discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which introduces the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship. Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory. Many commenters express enthusiasm for the idea of acquisition entrepreneurship, citing the low initial investment and potential for high returns. However, concerns are also raised about the difficulty of consistently achieving 10% growth and the potential risks associated with financing a large portion of the acquisition. Overall, commenters seem intrigued by the concept but also aware of its potential challenges. The most upvoted comment emphasizes the importance of careful research and due diligence before embarking on an acquisition entrepreneurial venture.",
