    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed a small business owner who has been sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act for website inaccessibility, despite using an official Shopify theme and approved accessible apps.

Many commenters expressed support and sympathy for the owner and discussed potential solutions, such as collective action and holding Shopify accountable. Some positive points mentioned included the importance of accessibility for all individuals, regardless of disabilities, and the need for web providers to take responsibility for their products.
