The user has $300K cash to allocate but estimates needing $407,750 for the purchase, including a $1.725M offer (10% down), working capital, and advisor fees. Key concerns are the accuracy of their financial calculations and the reasonableness of their offer compared to the seller?s $1.8M reserve. They seek advice on validating their budget and offer, with suggestions to consult financial advisors, compare industry valuations, and engage business brokers for insights.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post in question discusses a user's potential purchase of a waste management business listed at $1.9M, with $1.9M in 2023 revenue, $325K net income, and $390K EBITDA. The user has $300K cash to allocate and estimates needing an additional $407,750 for the purchase, including a $1.725M offer (10% down), working capital, and advisor fees. While the user seeks advice on validating their budget and offer, concerns are raised about the accuracy of their financial calculations and the reasonableness of their offer compared to the seller?s $1.8M reserve. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of caution, with suggestions to consult financial advisors, compare industry valuations, and engage business brokers for insights.\n\nKey positive points raised by commenters include the potential for a solid return on investment, given the high revenue and net income figures, as well as the fact that the business is already established and generating consistent profits. Some commenters also point out that the user's budget and offer appear to be well thought out and researched.\n\nMain concerns raised revolve primarily around the accuracy of the user's financial calculations and the potential risk of overpaying for the business.
