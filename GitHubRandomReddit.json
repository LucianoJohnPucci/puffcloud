However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's frustrating experience with a small business that did not honor its advertised return policy. The majority of commenters agreed that the business should have covered the return shipping costs and processed the refund without requiring the item to be returned. Many praised the customer for attempting to resolve the issue directly with the business before considering a chargeback. However, some expressed sympathy for the business owner's potential financial struggles during the pandemic and suggested offering store credit instead. The overall sentiment was one of disappointment and distrust towards the business for not fulfilling its promises. The most upvoted comment stated, \"A return policy is only as good as its execution, and in this case, it's clear that the customer is being taken advantage of. It's a shame that the business is not standing by its guarantee and putting its profits over customer satisfaction.\"",
