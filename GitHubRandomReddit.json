They ship 30 to 50 boxes daily, primarily via FedEx, but face high shipping rates that impact profitability. Attempts to lower shipping costs have led to increased product prices, which did not yield positive results. The owner has also been solicited by Unishippers for potential savings but found their representatives untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx or UPS.",

    "Title": "The discussion revolves around a small business owner struggling with high shipping costs, which customers cite as a reason for cart abandonment. Despite shipping 30 to 50 boxes daily, efforts to lower costs have not been successful and have even led to increased product prices. The owner has also been approached by Unishippers for potential savings, but their representatives were deemed untrustworthy. The main concerns raised by commenters were the impact of high shipping rates on profitability and the difficulty in finding reliable and trustworthy shipping solutions. However, some commenters shared positive experiences with FedEx and UPS, suggesting that the owner should negotiate better rates directly with these carriers. The overall sentiment is one of frustration and empathy towards the small business owner's struggles with shipping costs. The most upvoted comment advises the owner to reach out to a freight broker or consultant to negotiate better rates with carriers, as it has been successful for some business owners in similar situations.",
