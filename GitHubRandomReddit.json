    "Title": "The Reddit post in question sparked a discussion about the misconception that owning a small business is a passive endeavor. Many commenters agreed with the author's point that while it may not be \"hands-off,\" it can involve delegating and automating tasks to focus on higher-leverage activities. They emphasized the need for strategic effort in true passive business ownership, rather than completely neglecting the business. Some positive points mentioned were the potential for growth and flexibility in owning a small business, as well as the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment it can bring. However, some commenters raised concerns about the challenges and sacrifices that come with being a small business owner, such as long hours and financial risks. The overall sentiment of the commenters was mostly in agreement with the author's argument that there is no such thing as a truly passive small business, but rather the need for strategic management and hard work. One comment with the most upvotes stated, \"Owning a small business may not be passive, but it's worth the effort when done right.\"",
