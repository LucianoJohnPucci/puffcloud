    "Title": "This Reddit post sparked a discussion about a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after realizing it wasn't suitable, returned it for a $14 shipping fee. However, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and when the customer asked for a refund, the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item. This resulted in the customer incurring an additional $14 cost and considering a chargeback. Many commenters expressed disappointment in the business's handling of the situation, feeling that the return policy was not honored fairly. The top upvoted comment stated, \"The business should honor the return policy without forcing the customer to pay additional fees. This is not good customer service and will only lead to negative reviews and potential loss of future business.\"",
