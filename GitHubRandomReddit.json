    "Title": "The Reddit post features a small business owner questioning whether they should sell their app for 2 million dollars, as it is currently bringing in a stable profit. The main positive points raised include the potential for a significant payout and the validation of their hard work and success. However, some commenters raised concerns about the potential for the app's growth and the feasibility of maintaining the same income from the app in the future. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is split, with some advising to sell and others recommending to hold onto the app. The comment with the most upvotes suggests exploring alternative financing options to hold onto the app and continue building its success.",
