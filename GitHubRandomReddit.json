The example suggests that if the business grows by 10% annually, it could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. The author questions the realism of consistent 10% annual growth for a decade and seeks insights on small business niches or scenarios that could achieve this profile.",

    "Title": "In the Reddit post, individuals discuss the potential of acquisition entrepreneurship as presented in Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario involves purchasing a business for $1M, with a $100K personal investment and a 90% SBA loan, that earns $1.5M in revenue and $200K in SDE. The example suggests that with 10% annual growth, the business could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. Overall, commenters highlight the positive aspect of having a solid plan and emphasizing the importance of market research and due diligence before purchasing a business. They also discuss potential niches that could achieve consistent growth, such as technology or renewable energy. However, concerns are raised regarding the reality of achieving 10% annual growth for a decade and the potential risks involved in such investments. The overall sentiment from the commenters is that the scenario presented in the book may be too optimistic and that individual circumstances and industry trends should be carefully considered. The most upvoted comment states, \"The idea of consistent 10% growth for a decade is unrealistic and extremely risky. However, with careful planning and continuous adaptation, small business owners can achieve long-term success.\"",
