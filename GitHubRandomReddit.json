    "Title": "A small business owner took to Reddit to seek advice on a situation with a supplier. The owner sells clothes and shoes on Instagram and found a supplier who contacted them directly. The owner requested exclusivity in their region, but later discovered that the supplier is also messaging their competitors. Many Redditors offered suggestions on how to approach and negotiate with the supplier, with some positive points being made about the potential benefits of having exclusivity. However, some expressed concerns about the feasibility of convincing the supplier to only sell to one business, as well as the risks of alienating the supplier or others in the industry. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some offering support and others cautioning against pursuing exclusivity. The top upvoted comment was from chavaburr, who mentioned the importance of building a strong relationship with the supplier and finding creative solutions to ensure their business's success.",
