    "Title": "The Reddit post delves into the flawed advice given to entrepreneurs that a good product will simply sell itself, and instead highlights the necessity of effective marketing strategies and online engagement.

They highlight the importance of understanding and targeting the right audience, creating a strong brand image, and constantly adapting to market changes. Concerns are raised that this misconception may lead to early business failures and the need for entrepreneurs to understand the importance of marketing and promoting their product. Overall, commenters express frustration with the common belief that a good product alone is enough, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach to success. The most upvoted comment states, \"Marketing is key, no matter how good your product is, it won't sell itself if no one knows about it.\"",
