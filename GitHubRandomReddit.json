    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the misconception that a good product will simply sell itself and asks for experiences and strategies to counter this myth. The majority of commenters agree that although having a great product is important, effective marketing strategies and online engagement are crucial for success. Several positive points are raised, such as the power of word of mouth and the importance of building relationships with potential customers. However, main concerns include the danger of relying solely on word of mouth and the need for a balance between a great product and effective marketing. Overall, the sentiment is that while having a good product is necessary, entrepreneurs must also invest time and effort into marketing and engaging with their audience. The comment with the most upvotes reinforces this sentiment, stating, \"A great product may attract initial attention, but without marketing and engagement, it won't last.\"",
