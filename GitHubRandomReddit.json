A good number is defined to be any positive integer that can be written in the form $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. All other numbers are defined to be bad. What is the total number of bad integers in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 12345678}?\n\n## [enter: math-user2, num_posts=4, num_likes_received=3]\n## [math-user2, num_likes=3]\nAll numbers between $2^2$ and $4656^2$ are good numbers, so there are $4655-1+1=4655$ (total numbers - $1$ & + $1$) multiples of $2^2$ such that each multiple is a good number. Next in Artesia world, the numbers between $(2^2)^2$ and $(2153^2)^2$ can be written in the form $p^4$ where $p$ is a prime number. There are $2153-1+1=2153$ numbers in this range that are of the form $p^4$ for some prime number, so there will have $(2153)^2-1$ good numbers. In general, for any number, $N=p_1^{a_1}.p_2^{a_2}....p_n^{a_n}$, where $p_i$'s are distinct prime numbers, there will have $(p_1^2)^{a_1-1}.(p",
