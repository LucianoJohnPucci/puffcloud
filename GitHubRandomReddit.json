    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a clothing and shoe seller on Instagram is facing difficulties with their supplier, who is violating their exclusivity agreement by reaching out to competitors in the seller's region. Many commenters agree that this behavior is unfair and damaging to the seller's business. Some suggest that the seller should remind the supplier of their signed agreement and emphasize the potential loss of future orders if exclusivity is not respected. Others propose finding a new supplier altogether. However, some commenters raise concerns about the legal implications and the practicality of finding a new supplier. Overall, most commenters express sympathy towards the seller's situation and advocate for the supplier to honor their agreement. The most upvoted comment reads, \"This is a clear breach of contract and you should remind the supplier of the consequences they could face if they continue to violate the exclusivity agreement. Don't be afraid to stand up for your business.\"",
