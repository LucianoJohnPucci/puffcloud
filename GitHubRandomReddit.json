However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost.

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shares their frustrating experience with a small business regarding a $50 item they returned, but was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and ultimately resulted in the customer facing an additional $14 cost to receive a refund. The main positive points raised by commenters include appreciating the customer's efforts to support a small business and the business's 30-day return policy and satisfaction guarantee. However, the main concerns raised revolve around the business not honoring their return policy fairly by not covering the return shipping and insisting on receiving the item before providing a refund. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business is not handling the situation appropriately and the customer is justified in considering a chargeback. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"If a business has a return policy, they should honor it completely. Making the customer pay for return shipping is against the spirit of a 'satisfaction guarantee.'\"",
