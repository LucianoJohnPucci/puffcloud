The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business was reviewed and analyzed by AI experts on Reddit. The campaign spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, resulting in a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to booked jobs. The main positive points noted by commenters were the satisfactory results and decent return on ad spend (ROAS), as well as the indication of immediate buyer intent from most of the callers. However, the campaign was also seen as average, with only one call every three days, and concerns were raised about refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve effectiveness. The overall sentiment of the commenters was neutral, with some acknowledging the positive ROI while others were disappointed with the low call volume. The most upvoted comment was one that emphasized the need for continuous improvement and suggested implementing the planned future strategies.",
