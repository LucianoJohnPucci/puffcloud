    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the journey of an author who started their own business in 2007 and managed to survive the 2008 crash by working from home and leveraging their years of experience and client loyalty. However, despite their efforts, the rising costs in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic made their business unsustainable. As a result, they are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. The discussion drew a mix of both positive and negative reactions from the commenters. Some applauded the author for their resilience and for not closing their business in 2020 like many other small businesses. Others expressed concerns over the challenges faced by self-employed individuals and the impact of rising costs on small businesses. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic and empathetic towards the author's situation. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"It's great to see that you are adjusting to survive rather than just giving up. Wishing you the best of luck moving forward.\" This comment encapsulates the main themes discussed in the thread, highlighting the author's determination and resilience as well as the challenges faced by small businesses in these times.",
