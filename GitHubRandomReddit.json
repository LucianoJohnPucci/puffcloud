    "Link": "A small business owner with over a decade of experience is struggling with declining sales this year, largely due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",

    "Title": "The thread is started by a small business owner who is struggling with declining sales due to high shipping costs, with almost 90% of abandoned cart customers citing this as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx and has attempted to lower shipping costs, resulting in losses and eventually price hikes that did not improve sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but is hesitant to trust them. The main positive points raised by commenters include the need to negotiate with FedEx and UPS for better rates, as well as exploring other shipping options. Concerns were mostly centered around the business owner's lack of knowledge on negotiating shipping rates and hesitation towards using Unishippers. The overall sentiment of commenters is empathetic towards the struggles of small business owners and the need for finding cost-effective solutions. The comment with the most upvotes suggests partnering with other businesses to increase shipping volume and leverage this for better rates from FedEx and UPS.",
