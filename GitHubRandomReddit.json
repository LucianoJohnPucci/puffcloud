    "Title": "In a Reddit post, a business owner discusses their frustration with the Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature activated by Stripe, which triggered \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds despite their successful and established business with no previous issues. While they expected quick and efficient assistance from Stripe support, the owner received generic responses that caused cash flow problems. Commenters shared similar experiences with RDR and the lack of clear communication from Stripe support. Some positive points mentioned were Stripe's reputation for reliable payment processing and the benefit of RDR for preventing chargebacks. However, the main concern raised was the lack of transparency and specific guidelines for the \"enhanced due diligence\" process, leading to unexpected payment holds and delays. Commenters expressed frustration and disappointment with Stripe's lack of clear communication and generic responses. The top upvoted comment echoed the sentiment that the lack of transparency and communication from Stripe support is unacceptable for a company that prides itself on being the \"best-in-class payment processor.\"",
