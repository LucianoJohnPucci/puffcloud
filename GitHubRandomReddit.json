    "Title": "The Reddit post centers around a handmade jewelry business owner seeking advice on negotiating a profitable margin with a boutique owner interested in carrying their products. The jeweler is hesitant as they have never produced high quantities before, but the boutique owner is requesting a minimum of 50 units of each design. Within the discussion, there are several key positives points, such as the importance of knowing the production costs and setting clear expectations with the boutique owner. However, there are also concerns raised, including the risk of overproduction and the impact on pricing. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that this is a great opportunity for the jeweler, but caution and careful planning are necessary. The most upvoted comment advises the jeweler to negotiate a lower minimum order quantity or offer a discount if the boutique owner agrees to stock all their stores.",
