    "Title": "In this Reddit thread, a small jewelry business owner is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a chain of small boutiques interested in carrying their products. The main concern raised by commenters is the jeweler's lack of experience in producing high quantities and the boutique owner's request for a minimum of 50 units per design.
