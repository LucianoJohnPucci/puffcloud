    "Title": "The Reddit post centers around a small business owner who is facing declining sales due to high shipping costs. Despite offering USPS and FedEx options, 90% of abandoned cart feedback cited expensive shipping. The owner has attempted to lower shipping costs but ended up with losses and had to increase product prices, which did not resolve the issue. The owner struggles to negotiate better rates with FedEx or UPS and is hesitant to trust third-party solutions like Unishippers due to poor transparency and reviews. The commenters suggested alternative shipping options, such as using regional carriers, renegotiating contracts, and reducing packaging materials. However, others pointed out that it may be difficult to find cheaper shipping options that also provide reliable and timely service. The overall sentiment of the commenters is empathetic towards the struggles of the small business owner, with many sharing their own experiences and offering helpful advice. The most upvoted comment suggests using FedEx's \"SmartPost\" option, which can reduce costs for businesses shipping large volumes.",
