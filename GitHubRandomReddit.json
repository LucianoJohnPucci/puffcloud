    "Title": "The Reddit post in question discusses whether a small business owner should sell their app for $2 million, despite it being currently successful. In general, commenters have pointed out the positive aspects of such a sale, such as the financial stability it could bring and the potential for future growth under new ownership. However, some raised concerns about the possibility of regret in the long run, as well as the importance of considering the app's potential for further success and its uniqueness in the market. Overall, the sentiment of commenters seems to be in favor of considering the sale, but following a thorough evaluation of all factors. The top comment, with the most upvotes, states \"If the offer is legit and in the ballpark of your valuation, it's time to think about selling. You're already thinking about it, which is a good sign.\"",
