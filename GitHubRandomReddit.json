    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shares their frustration with a small business that did not honor their return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return period and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after returning the item and paying $14 for shipping, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed.\" The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing the refund, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. Commenters express their disappointment with the business for not honoring their return policy and placing the burden on the customer. They also question the logic of requiring the item to be returned before processing the refund. The overall sentiment is one of frustration and disappointment, with many commenters suggesting a chargeback as a solution. One of the top comments with upvotes reads, \"If they had proper customer service they would understand they need to pay the shipping fee back to you.\"",
