    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item, but after realizing it wasn't suitable, they returned it for a $14 shipping fee. However, due to delivery attempts and USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed,\" it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but they refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item back, costing the customer an additional $14. Commenters highlighted the positive aspects of the business's return policy, including the 30-day return option and 100% satisfaction guarantee. However, the main concern raised was the inconvenience and extra cost the customer faced due to the business's insistence on receiving the item back before issuing a refund. The overall sentiment of the commenters was frustration and disappointment with the business's response and consideration of a chargeback. One top comment with the most upvotes was, \"Charging for return shipping in this situation is unacceptable. The business should have covered the cost and honored their return policy.\"",
