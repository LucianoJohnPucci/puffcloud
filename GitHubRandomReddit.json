    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner selling clothes and shoes on Instagram has shared their experience with a supplier who contacted them directly. The owner requested exclusivity in their region, but discovered that the supplier is also messaging their competitors. The discussion starts with commenters praising the owner for securing a direct supplier, which can lead to cost savings and better quality control. However, the main concern raised is regarding the exclusivity request and its feasibility. Some commenters suggest negotiating a contract or offering incentives, while others warn of the possibility of the supplier breaking the agreement. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some expressing support for the owner's request and others cautioning against it. The most upvoted comment advises the owner to focus on building their brand and customer base, rather than worrying about a single supplier.",
