    "Title": "This Reddit post features a business owner with nine years of experience who is facing challenges in selling their company, despite price reductions and hiring a new broker. The owner seeks advice on whether to continue working with the broker, explore creative selling strategies, and the feasibility of an employee buyout. They also inquire about options for closing the business and potential buyer targets.
