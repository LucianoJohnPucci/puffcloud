    "Title": "In this Reddit post, users discuss whether success in entrepreneurship is determined by hard work and strategy, or if timing and connections play a bigger role. Many commenters believe that a combination of both elements is necessary for success, and cite examples of successful entrepreneurs who have relied on both hard work and strategic thinking, as well as serendipity and networking. However, others express concern that despite the effort and preparation put in, success in entrepreneurship still seems unattainable for many. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be a mix of optimism and frustration, with some believing that success is within reach for those who truly put in the work, while others acknowledge that luck and connections can also be powerful forces. The most upvoted comment, with 23 upvotes, states, \"It's not one or the other, it's both. The key is to recognize the opportunities and have the skills and network to take advantage of them when they arise.\"",
