The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. While the conversion rate of 57% and cost per call of $14.28 were satisfactory, commenters expressed concerns about the low average call rate of one every three days. Some suggested refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's different departments to improve the effectiveness of the campaign. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many noting the importance of the immediate needs of the callers and the potential for future success with optimized targeting.
