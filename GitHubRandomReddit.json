The goal is to grow revenue by 10% annually and potentially sell the business for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and which small business niches might be suitable for this growth model.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a potential scenario outlined in Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" where acquisition entrepreneurs can purchase a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200k in SDE with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow revenue by 10% annually and potentially sell the business for $3-4M in ten years. The overall sentiment from commenters is mixed, with some pointing out the potential positive aspects of the scenario such as low initial investment and attractive returns, while others raise concerns about the realistic feasibility of consistent 10% growth over a decade. Many commenters also question which specific small business niches would be suitable for this growth model and advise careful research and due diligence before making any decisions. The top upvoted comment suggests that a combination of careful planning and hard work will be key to achieving success in this scenario.",
