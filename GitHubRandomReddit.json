    "Title": "Many of the commenters on this Reddit post sympathize with the college student's plight and offer helpful suggestions for the struggling high-end clothing store. Some of the key positive points discussed are the store's unique offerings, such as custom dresses and jean resizing, which sets it apart from other stores. Additionally, the store's location in a high-income suburb presents a promising target audience. However, the main concerns raised are the store's pricing range, which may be too high for the current economic climate, and the lack of foot traffic, which could be due to a lack of online presence and marketing efforts. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is one of hope and encouragement, with many suggesting strategies to improve business, such as increasing social media presence and potentially reaching out to local wedding planners. The comment with the most upvotes suggests seeking professional advice and analyzing the financials before making any drastic decisions like closing the store.",
