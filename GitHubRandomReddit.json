    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post sparked a discussion about a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy and refund process. The majority of commenters agreed that the business should have covered the cost of return shipping, as the customer had followed the return policy and the package was not successfully delivered. Some also pointed out that it was unfair for the business to require the physical return of the item in order to process a refund, especially given the added cost to the customer. Many expressed frustration and disappointment with the way the business handled the situation, with some suggesting a chargeback as a potential solution. One commenter with the most upvotes stated, \"A customer should not have to pay for the consequences of the post office's mistake. This business needs to honor their return policy and make it right for the customer.\"",
