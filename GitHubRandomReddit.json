    "Title": "On Reddit, users are discussing a customer's experience with a small business that has a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" policy. The customer ordered a $50 item but ended up returning it and paying $14 for shipping. Unfortunately, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender after three failed delivery attempts. The customer contacted the business for a refund but was told they would have to cover the return shipping costs and return the item before receiving the refund, resulting in another $14 expense. This has left the customer frustrated and considering a chargeback as they feel the business is not honoring their return policy fairly. While some commenters commended the business for having a clear return policy, many raised concerns about the extra cost and inconvenience faced by the customer in this situation. The overall sentiment appears to be one of disappointment and frustration towards the business, with many users expressing sympathy for the customer's situation. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the need for businesses to be more understanding and empathetic towards their customers in such cases.",
