    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a small business that was started in 2007 by the author, who had 22 years of experience and client loyalty. Despite facing challenges such as the 2008 crash and the COVID-19 pandemic, the business survived by working from home and avoiding real estate costs. However, rising costs in 2020 (up 50%) have made it difficult to sustain the business, leading the author and their husband to consider a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. Many commenters expressed admiration for the author's resilience and success in navigating difficult times, while others highlighted concerns about the sustainability of the business model and the potential risks of relying on a single vendor. The overall sentiment was sympathetic but also realistic, acknowledging the challenges faced by small businesses and the need to adapt in order to survive. The most upvoted comment stated: \"It's tough to see small businesses struggle, especially after all the hard work and dedication. But at least they have a plan for the future and are not just giving up.\"",
