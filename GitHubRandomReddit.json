    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author shares their experience of running an online business for a year. They express a sense of surrealism as they reflect on how they now earn more money overnight from automation than they used to in two weeks at their previous job. This elicits a mix of satisfaction and discomfort as they compare their situation to that of their friends who are still working traditional 9-5 jobs. While the author acknowledges the benefits of their automated systems generating income with minimal effort, they also question the fairness of the system and highlight the disparity between their situation and that of their friends. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be one of admiration for the author's success but at the same time, there is a concern for the potential consequences of such drastic income disparity. One comment with the most upvotes reads, \"It's amazing how automation has changed the game for online businesses, but it also highlights the inequality in society.\"",
