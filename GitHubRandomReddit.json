    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the challenges faced by a small business owner who ships 30-50 boxes daily and is struggling with declining sales due to high shipping costs. Despite offering USPS and FedEx options, 90% of abandoned cart feedback cited expensive shipping. The owner has tried to lower shipping costs but this resulted in losses and forced them to increase product prices, which didn't resolve the issue. The owner is also having difficulty negotiating better rates with FedEx or UPS and is apprehensive about third-party solutions like Unishippers because of poor transparency and reviews. In response, commenters suggest alternative shipping options such as regional carriers and packaging optimization. Some also advise the owner to focus on providing value to customers and not to just compete on price. The overall sentiment in the discussion is that the owner is not alone in facing these challenges and that there are possible solutions. The comment with the most upvotes emphasizes the importance of communication and negotiation with shipping companies. User 'TheRealSlothbear' suggests, \"It's all about communication with carriers. Find out why rates are so high and see if you can negotiate terms or drop carriers.\"",
