    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner who sells clothes and shoes on Instagram has found a supplier who has contacted them directly. The owner requested exclusivity in their region, but discovered the supplier is also messaging their competitors. Many commenters praised the business owner for their proactive approach and for finding an interested supplier. They agreed that exclusivity would be beneficial for the business. However, the main concern raised was whether the supplier can be trusted to uphold their exclusivity promise, as they have already approached competitors. Some commenters suggested negotiating a contract with clear terms and consequences for breaching exclusivity. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that the business owner should take measures to protect their business and exclusivity. The top voted comment, by user \"SavvySeller\", expressed similar sentiments and suggested setting up a meeting with the supplier to discuss their concerns and establish a solid agreement.",
