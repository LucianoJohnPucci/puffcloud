    "Title": "The Reddit post in question raises concerns about fake posts on the smallbusiness subreddit promoting a solution called Wosily. These posts are typically made by new accounts with no genuine post history and are quickly removed once called out. Users suggest banning mentions of Wosily and implementing measures to prevent fake threads on the subreddit. The main positive point is the recognition and acknowledgement of this issue, while the key concerns are the impact on the subreddit's credibility and the need for effective solutions. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and disappointment, with some expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of proposed measures. The comment with the most upvotes suggests implementing a minimum account age and/or karma requirement for posting in the subreddit to filter out fake accounts.",
