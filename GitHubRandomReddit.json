    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the common but often misleading advice given to entrepreneurs that a good product will sell itself without the need for effective marketing strategies or online engagement. Several commenters share their experiences of facing this misconception and highlight the importance of actively promoting and engaging with potential customers to drive sales. Positive points include the recognition that marketing and consumer engagement are crucial aspects of a successful business, and the acknowledgment that even the best products need effective promotion to reach their potential. Main concerns raised include the harm this misconception can have on new entrepreneurs who may overlook the importance of marketing and struggle to make sales. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is that while a good product is important, entrepreneurs should not underestimate the value of effective marketing and engagement. The top-upvoted comment from user u/GeniusGustavo states, \"I've seen way too many great products fail because the entrepreneurs believed this advice. Marketing is crucial for any business, no matter how awesome the product may be.\"",
