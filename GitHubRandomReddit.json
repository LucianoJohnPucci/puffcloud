    "Title": "This Reddit post centers on a customer who ordered a $50 item from a small business that had a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" However, after realizing the item was not suitable, the customer returned it, but it was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for return shipping and insisted on receiving the item first, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. Many commenters praised the small business for having a return policy and understanding the costs associated with running a business. However, they also expressed concerns about the business not honoring their return policy fairly and the extra costs being passed on to the customer. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that the customer had a legitimate grievance and was justified in considering a chargeback. The most upvoted comment expressed frustration with the business's poor customer service and advised the customer to follow through with a chargeback if necessary.",
