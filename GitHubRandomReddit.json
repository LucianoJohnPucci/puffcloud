The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

Most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent, and the campaign's overall ROAS was satisfactory. However, it was pointed out that the campaign only averaged one call every three days, showing room for improvement in targeting and ad group creation. Overall, the consensus among commenters was positive, with many highlighting the success of the campaign and offering suggestions for future improvements. The comment with the most upvotes suggested creating mobile-specific ads and using negative keywords to further refine targeting.",
