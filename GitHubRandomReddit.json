He is known for his modern and controversial subject matter, as well as his bold use of color and brushwork. Manet's most famous paintings include \"The Luncheon on the Grass\" and \"Olympia\", which both caused controversy for their depictions of nude women in everyday settings. He rejected traditional academic techniques and sought to capture the fleeting moments and sensations of modern life. Despite facing rejection from the art establishment, Manet's work greatly influenced later generations of artists, including the Impressionists, and he is now considered one of the most important figures in the history of modern art. Manet died in 1883 at the age of 51, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and challenge artists today. <|endoftext|>Stress can have a significant impact on our physical and mental health. It is a natural response to a perceived threat or challenge and can manifest in various ways, such as increased heart rate, tense muscles, or feelings of anxiety and overwhelm. While some amount of stress can be beneficial in motivating us to take action and deal with the challenges of daily life, chronic or excessive stress can have negative effects on our well-being.\n\nPhysical Effects of Stress\n\n1. Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: Chronic stress has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. When we experience stress, our body responds by releasing stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause our blood vessels to constrict and our heart rate to increase. This can put strain on our heart and increase our risk for heart disease.\n\n2. Weakened Immune System: Stress can suppress our immune system, making us more susceptible to illnesses and infections. It does this by lowering the number of white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting off infections, and increasing inflammation in the body. This can lead to frequent illnesses and slower healing times.",
