They began in Spring 2017 with a $20 gift card, quickly grew their inventory to $1,000 through trading, and later developed the site with help from a developer. By Fall 2018, they had 16,000 unique users and achieved monthly profits of $1,100. However, profits declined due to poor ad returns, and by Winter 2018, the student reduced their involvement due to academic commitments. In Spring 2019, they sold 90% of the site for $2,200, realizing they had learned valuable lessons about entrepreneurship and marketing, having processed over $250,000 in trades and withdrawn over $12,000 in profits.",
