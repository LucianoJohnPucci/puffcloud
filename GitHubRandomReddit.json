    "Title": "In a Reddit thread, a marketing company owner expresses frustration with unsolicited offers from self-proclaimed digital marketing experts offering various services including SEO, website optimization, social media growth, and AI tools. Many commenters agree that these offers lack credibility and highlight the importance of doing research and building a strong online presence. The thread acknowledges that some of these services may be useful, but the overarching concern is about the quality and authenticity of these self-proclaimed experts. Commenters also point out that established companies likely already have these services in place and do not need unsolicited offers. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of skepticism towards these offers and an emphasis on finding reputable and trustworthy sources. The top-voted comment cautions against falling for these types of offers and suggests finding a reputable marketing agency instead, with other commenters echoing this sentiment and sharing their own negative experiences with similar offers.",
