Some also share their personal experiences of initially relying solely on the quality of their product but eventually realizing the importance of promoting it. Concerns were raised about the high cost of marketing and the difficulty of standing out in a saturated market. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while having a good product is essential, it is not enough to guarantee success. The most upvoted comment sums it up well: \"Marketing creates awareness and great products create loyalty. You need to have both to be successful.\"",
