    "Title": "In a Reddit post, an author shared their experience joining an entrepreneur group focused on fast growth and investor funding, but ultimately realizing they preferred stable growth and self-funding. They faced criticism for their stance on not working enough and instead valuing work-life balance while aiming to build a business that supports their lifestyle. Despite feeling hurt by the criticism, the author remains determined to continue their business journey without the support of the entrepreneur group. The key positive points highlighted in the discussion center around the importance of prioritizing work-life balance and building a business that aligns with one's lifestyle choices. However, the main concerns raised by commenters involve the potential limitations and challenges that may arise from solely self-funding and foregoing the support and resources of an entrepreneur group. The overall sentiment of the commenters is empathetic and supportive of the author's stance, with many acknowledging the difficulty of finding a balance between fast growth and personal well-being. The top upvoted comment reads, \"I commend you for staying true to your values and priorities. It takes courage to go against the norm and build a business on your own terms.\"",
