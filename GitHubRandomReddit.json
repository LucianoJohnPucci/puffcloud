The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The overall sentiment of the commenters is positive, with many noting the decent ROAS and the immediate needs of the callers indicating strong buyer intent. Key positive points include the effectiveness of the campaign in generating calls and the potential for even better results with future refinements in keyword targeting and ad group creation. Main concerns raised include the low frequency of calls, with one commenter noting that the average of one call every three days may not be enough for the business. The comment with the most upvotes suggests focusing on local targeting and using negative keywords to avoid irrelevant clicks.",
