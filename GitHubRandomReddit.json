After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",
