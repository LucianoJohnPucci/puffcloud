    "Title": "The author of a recent reddit post is investigating which industries are truly flourishing amidst the struggles faced by small businesses. Among the industries mentioned, construction and tradespeople seem to be faring better in recent times. Many commenters agreed with this observation, citing an increase in demand for home improvement projects and essential services such as plumbing and electric work. Some also pointed out that the government's stimulus packages and low-interest rates have contributed to the success of these industries. However, concerns were raised about the sustainability of this growth and the long-term effects of the pandemic on these businesses. Some commenters also noted that this success may not be the case for all construction and trade businesses and could vary based on location and target market. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was cautiously optimistic. The most popular comment, with the most upvotes, suggested that industries that offer essential services and have adapted to the new normal may continue to thrive in the coming months.",
