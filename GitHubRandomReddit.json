The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business is analyzed. Over a span of 21 days, the campaign spent $100 and generated 1,800 impressions, resulting in 7 calls with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The campaign also revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating a strong buyer intent. While the results were deemed satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend, it was noted that the campaign only received one call every three days. In light of this, future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness. Positive aspects highlighted by commenters include the relatively low cost per call and high conversion rate, indicating a targeted audience. Some concerns were raised regarding the frequency of calls, with suggestions for further optimization.
