    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the writer?s concerns about an increasing number of ?horror stories? involving Stripe, a popular payment processor. The writer has noticed a spike in incidents where small businesses are facing frozen funds, requests for enhanced due diligence, and feeling ?held hostage? by Stripe. These issues seem to be connected to enabling Stripe?s RDR feature. Some positive points raised by commenters include the convenience and ease of use of Stripe, as well as its competitive fees. However, the main concerns revolve around the power payment processors have over small businesses, the lack of transparency and communication from Stripe, and the potential for abuse of this power. The overall sentiment of commenters is one of frustration and dissatisfaction with Stripe?s actions and policies.
