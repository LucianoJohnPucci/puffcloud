    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a small business owner who was facing declining sales and implemented an automated email to inquire about abandoned carts, discovering that high shipping costs were a major factor. The business ships 30-50 boxes daily and has been frustrated by persistent sales pitches from Unishippers. Key positive points identified by commenters include the use of automated emails and attempts to lower shipping rates.
