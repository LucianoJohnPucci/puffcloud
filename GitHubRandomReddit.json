    "Title": "In a Reddit post, a person in their 40s shares that they have been successfully managing a side hustle that outperforms their full-time job for the past three years. Due to declining mental and physical health, they resigned without disclosing their side hustle. While the company offered to adjust their schedule, the author is skeptical about maintaining the same workload with reduced hours. They are now considering asking for a raise, even if it puts them at risk for future layoffs, as they see their current job as the end of their corporate career and value the remote work flexibility. The commenters are supportive of the author's success and applaud their decision to prioritize their health. Some suggest speaking to HR or negotiating a severance package if the raise request is denied. The main concern raised is about the company's reaction and potential consequences. However, overall sentiment is sympathetic and encouraging, with many suggesting the author should pursue their side hustle full-time. The top-rated comment advises the author to prioritize self-care and not be afraid to take risks for their happiness.",
