They mention having a 25% gross profit and keeping separate business checking/savings accounts and credit card. However, they are seeking advice on how frequently to pay themselves, as their business has not yet launched. Many users praise their wise decision to maintain separate accounts and credit cards, highlighting the importance of good financial management in running a successful business. Some suggest determining their salary based on their business's projected budget and expenses. Others suggest paying themselves a smaller salary initially and gradually increasing it as their business grows. The main concerns raised include the uncertainty of paying oneself without an established business and the potential risks of not paying oneself enough or too much. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is positive, with many offering helpful advice and book recommendations such as \"Profit First\" and \"The 4-Hour Work Week.\" The comment with the most upvotes suggests paying oneself a small amount initially and increasing it only when the business is making a consistent profit.",
