    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's experience with a small business that offers a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee. After the customer returned a $50 item that was not suitable, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender by USPS. The customer was then asked to cover the $14 return shipping cost in order to receive a refund, leading to frustration and consideration of a chargeback. The key positive points mentioned in the comments include the customer's right to expect their return shipping costs to be covered by the business, as well as the importance of honoring the return policy regardless of any external factors like USPS errors. The main concerns raised are about the business's lack of responsiveness and fair treatment of the customer, as well as the potential harm to the business's reputation. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is negative, with many expressing disappointment in the business and support for the customer. The comment with the most upvotes reads, \"That's just bad business. The customer should not have to pay for the return shipping if the item is not as described. Honor your own policies.\"",
