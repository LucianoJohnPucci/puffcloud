    "Title": "The Reddit post revolves around the writer's concern over an increase in negative experiences with the payment processor Stripe. Many small businesses have reported frozen funds, requests for enhanced due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\" by Stripe. This issue seems to be especially prevalent when using Stripe's RDR feature, causing the writer to worry about the power payment processors have over smaller businesses. Commenters shared positive experiences with Stripe, such as easy setup and good customer service, but also highlighted the need for better communication from Stripe when implementing RDR. The main concerns raised were the lack of transparency and accountability from Stripe, as well as the potential impact on small businesses. The overall sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some sharing similar horror stories and others stating that they have had no issues with Stripe. The comment with the most upvotes emphasized the need for small businesses to have options and not be at the mercy of payment processors.",
