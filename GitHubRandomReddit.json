    "Title": "This Reddit post showcases a customer's frustration with a small business's return policy. The business offers a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after the customer returned the $50 item and paid $14 for shipping, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The business then refused to pay for return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, causing the customer to face an additional $14 cost. Some commenters praised the business for honoring their return policy and suggested that the customer should have checked the shipping and return policies before ordering. However, the majority of commenters expressed concerns about the unfairness of this situation and supported the customer's frustration and potential chargeback. The top comment with the most upvotes stated, \"If the business has a 30-day return policy, they should honor it without making the customer incur additional costs. That's just good customer service.\"",
