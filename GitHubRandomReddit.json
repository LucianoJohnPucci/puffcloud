    "Title": "The Reddit post by a small business owner sparked a discussion on the misconceptions of owning a business. While acknowledging that with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, reducing workload through automation and delegation is possible, the author challenges the notion that running a successful business can be completely hands-off. Many commenters shared their positive experiences with implementing these strategies, such as focusing on high-leverage tasks and streamlining processes. However, there were concerns raised about the sustainability of this approach and the potential for burnout. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that while it is possible to lessen the workload through smart management, owning a business still requires significant effort. The most upvoted comment aptly states, \"Running a business is like being a parent - it's a full-time job and it never stops.\" Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between delegation and personal involvement in order to successfully run a business.",
