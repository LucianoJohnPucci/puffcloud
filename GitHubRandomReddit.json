Many commenters agreed that while hard work and strategy are essential for success, having the right timing and connections can also be crucial. Some pointed out that luck also plays a significant role, and those who are born into wealthy families have a significant advantage in terms of connections and resources. The post also raised concerns about the seemingly unattainable success for many aspiring entrepreneurs, especially those without privileged backgrounds. Commenters also highlighted the importance of adaptability and being able to pivot when faced with unexpected challenges. The overall sentiment among commenters was that success in entrepreneurship is a combination of hard work, strategy, timing, and connections, but luck and privilege also play a significant role.

But you also have to be adaptable and willing to take risks.\"",
