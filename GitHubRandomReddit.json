    "Link": "The creator of **everm?e**, a digital locket primarily targeting the US and Canada, seeks feedback on their website and product presentation to improve low conversion rates (2 sales from 2.5k visitors). The product is unfamiliar and in a higher price segment, requiring customer education. Despite positive offline feedback (e.g., at LVMH Prize, Paris Fashion Week), online sales struggle. Limited ad spend ($400) on Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, and Pinterest has yielded minimal results, though influencer marketing shows promise but is slow and unscalable. Key concerns include unclear product communication, lack of size guides, insufficient videos, and potential confusion in the ordering process. Brutally honest feedback is requested to address issues and improve online sales. Collaboration offers are also welcomed.",

However, concerns were raised about unclear product communication, lack of size guides, and potential confusion in the ordering process. The overall sentiment of the commenters is critical but constructive, with a focus on offering suggestions for improvement rather than solely pointing out flaws. The most upvoted comment states that the product has potential but needs to clarify its messaging for better customer education.",
