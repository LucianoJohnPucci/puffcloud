    "Title": "The Reddit post highlights a user's consideration of purchasing a waste management business for $1.9M, with solid financials of $1.9M in 2023 revenue, $325K net income, and $390K EBITDA. However, the user is seeking advice on the accuracy of their calculations and the reasonableness of their offer compared to the seller's $1.8M reserve, as they only have $300K cash to allocate for the purchase. Positive points raised by commenters include suggestions to consult with financial advisors, compare industry valuations, and engage business brokers for their insights. Some key concerns raised include the potential need for more working capital and the possibility of overvaluing the business due to a lack of experience in the industry. The overall sentiment of the commenters is cautious optimism, with many advising the user to do thorough research and seek professional advice before making a decision. The most upvoted comment comes from a user who suggests consulting a business broker to negotiate a lower offer and potentially save on advisor fees, ultimately saving the user money in the long run.",
