    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the common misconception that a good product will sell itself, and asks for experiences from others to counter this belief. Many commenters agreed that while having a quality product is important, effective marketing and online engagement are crucial for success as an entrepreneur. They highlighted the need for a targeted and well-executed marketing strategy, utilizing various platforms such as social media and email marketing. The main concern raised was that having a great product alone is not enough to guarantee sales, and without proper marketing efforts, even the best products can fail. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that while having a good product is a great start, it takes more than that to be successful in business. The comment with the most upvotes echoes this sentiment, stating \"Marketing and promotion play a huge role in the success of a business. Without it, even the best products can go unnoticed.\"",
