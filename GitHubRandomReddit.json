They outline a simplified example where a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in seller's discretionary earnings (SDE) is purchased with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. The business is expected to grow 10% annually, allowing for a potential sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of maintaining consistent 10% growth over a decade and seeks insights on small business niches that could achieve such growth.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author is reviewing Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which discusses acquisition entrepreneurship using a hypothetical scenario. The post outlines a simplified example where a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in seller's discretionary earnings is bought with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. The business is projected to grow 10% annually, potentially leading to a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. While some commenters are optimistic about the growth potential of the business, many raise concerns about the feasibility of achieving consistent 10% growth over a decade. Some also question the risks involved in relying heavily on SBA loans and suggest exploring alternative investment strategies. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some seeing potential in the scenario and others expressing skepticism. The comment with the most upvotes suggests that industries such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy have the potential for sustained growth over ten years.",
