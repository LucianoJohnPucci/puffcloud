    "Title": "The small business owner of Cold Case Gear is disappointed with the results of the marketing firm they hired, despite investing a significant amount of money. They turned to the small business community on Reddit for advice on whether to continue working with the firm or adjust their expectations. While many commenters shared positive experiences with their own marketing firms, the main concern raised was the lack of measurable results and the need for clear communication and expectations from the marketing firm. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was optimistic but cautious, with a few warning against blindly trusting marketing firms and suggesting the owner take a more hands-on approach. The most upvoted comment advises the owner to have a realistic and data-driven approach to analyzing the results of the marketing campaign.",
