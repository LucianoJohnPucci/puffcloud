The CPA suggests labeling these expenses as ?Other Deductibles? with a statement, while the bookkeeper argues they should be classified under ?Cost of Goods Sold? (CoGS) to provide a clearer picture of business expenses and avoid potential audits. The bookkeeper believes that categorizing a large portion of expenses as miscellaneous could raise red flags with the IRS. The business owner is inclined to support the bookkeeper's recommendation but seeks additional input on the matter.",
