    "Title": "This Reddit post critiques the current trend of AI agents, arguing that they are being used as a profit-making scheme by tech companies, taking advantage of businesses' fear of missing out (FOMO). The main argument is that companies should prioritize addressing real business challenges rather than chasing overpriced AI solutions. Many commenters agree with this sentiment, noting that many AI agents available today are just advanced chatbots lacking true autonomy. They express concern about the hype surrounding AI and urge businesses to prioritize practicality over hype. However, some commenters also point out the potential benefits of AI in certain industries and argue that proper implementation and integration is key. The overall sentiment of the commenters is skeptical and critical of the current state of AI agents. The most upvoted comment states, \"I couldn't agree more. As someone who works in tech, I see how much companies are pushing AI as a solution for everything, even when it's not the most practical or effective.\"",
