    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses whether the poster should sell their app, which is currently making $400,000 per year, for $2 million. The key positive points revolve around the potential financial gain and the validation of selling for such a large sum. However, concerns were raised about the future growth potential of the app and the possibility of leaving money on the table. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be that selling for $2 million may not be the best decision and that the poster should consider options for further growth. The comment with the most upvotes suggests negotiating for a higher price or finding investors to help grow the app.",
