    "Link": "The post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which outlines the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship by providing a simplified mathematical example. It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and inquires about specific small business niches that might fit this model.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post delved into the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, highlighting Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" as a guide for potential investors. The simplified mathematical example presented was the purchase of a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in SDE, using a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The projected growth of the business at 10% annually over ten years, with a potential sale price of $3-4M, sparked a discussion about the realistic nature of this strategy and potential niches that would be ideal for it. Some positive points mentioned by commenters included the possibility for successful growth and a substantial return on investment, as well as the accessibility of SBA loans for small business owners. Main concerns raised included the difficulty of consistently achieving and sustaining a 10% growth rate, as well as the feasibility of finding small businesses with these particular figures. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters seemed skeptical but curious, with many acknowledging the potential of acquisition entrepreneurship but questioning its practicality. The most upvoted comment highlighted the need for thorough research and due diligence when it comes to acquiring businesses.",
