    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds, despite having a successful and established business with no prior issues. Many commenters have experienced similar issues with Stripe's lack of clear communication and generic responses, leading to cash flow problems. Positive points raised include the convenience and effectiveness of RDR, as well as Stripe's reliable payment system.
