    "Title": "The Reddit post expresses concern over the increase in Stripe payment processor horror stories, particularly regarding small businesses having their funds frozen and being asked for enhanced due diligence, causing them to feel \"held hostage.\" Many commenters agree that they have noticed a spike in such incidents, especially when using Stripe's RDR feature, and express worries about the power payment processors have over small businesses. Some positive points raised include Stripe's generally efficient and user-friendly platform, as well as its ability to integrate with other apps. However, the main concern is the lack of transparency and communication from Stripe when issues arise, leading to frustration and fear among small business owners. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and disappointment with Stripe's handling of these situations. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the need for small businesses to diversify their payment processors in order to avoid being dependent on one platform and at risk for being \"held hostage.\"",
