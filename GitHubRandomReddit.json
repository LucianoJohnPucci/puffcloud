    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a customer's frustration with a small business's return policy. The customer had ordered a $50 item with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" but ended up returning it for not being suitable. However, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender. The customer reached out to the business for a refund but was refused and asked to cover the $14 return shipping cost, leading to the customer considering a chargeback. One key positive point raised by commenters is the importance of reading and understanding a business's return policy before making a purchase. Some also argue that the customer should have made sure they were available to receive the package to avoid the issue. Main concerns revolved around the business's refusal to cover the return shipping cost and the customer's negative experience. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business should honor their return policy and cover the return shipping cost to maintain good customer relations. The comment with the most upvotes reads, \"This is terrible customer service. The business should process the refund without receiving the item back as it was their mistake.\"",
