However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The business had a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" for a $50 item, but after the customer returned it due to suitability issues, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender. The business refused to cover the $14 return shipping fee and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, causing the customer to incur an additional cost. While some commenters suggested the importance of reading return policies carefully and supporting small businesses, many expressed concern and frustration over the business's lack of accountability and poor customer service. The overall sentiment was negative, with many feeling that the business was not honoring its own policies fairly. The most upvoted comment urged the customer to file a chargeback and stated that the business's behavior was not only unfair but also potentially illegal.",
