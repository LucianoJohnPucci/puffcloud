    "Title": "In this post, a small business owner shared their experience of finding a supplier for their Instagram business, only to discover that the supplier was also messaging their competitors. The owner had initially requested exclusivity in their region, but is now seeking advice on how to convince the supplier to only sell to them. \n\nThe majority of commenters were supportive of the small business owner and provided helpful suggestions. Some key positive points include suggesting the owner to negotiate a formal exclusivity agreement, building a trusting relationship with the supplier, and offering unique and personalized services to differentiate their business. \n\nOne of the main concerns raised by commenters was about the legal implications of an exclusivity agreement and ensuring it is fair for both parties. There were also discussions about the importance of maintaining a good relationship with the supplier, as well as diversifying the business by partnering with other suppliers. \n\nThe overall sentiment of the commenters was one of understanding and empathy towards the business owner's situation. Many shared their own experiences and provided practical advice. \n\nThe comment with the most upvotes was from user u/rocksculpture who advised the owner to focus on providing exceptional services and quality products to their customers rather than worrying about exclusivity. They suggested that this would ultimately make the business stand out and attract more customers, regardless of the supplier's actions.",
