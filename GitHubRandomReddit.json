    "Title": "The Reddit post expresses concern about an increase in Stripe payment processor horror stories among small businesses. Some positive comments highlight the convenience and ease of use of Stripe for online payments. However, numerous commenters have raised concerns about funds being frozen, being asked for additional due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\" by Stripe's policies. Many have noticed a trend of these issues occurring more frequently when enabling Stripe's RDR feature. Overall, the sentiment is one of frustration and helplessness towards the power that payment processors have over small businesses. The top voted comment attributes these issues to a lack of transparency and accountability on the part of Stripe.",
