Some mention the importance of thoroughly researching before hiring any digital marketing services, while others share their personal experiences of being scammed by similar individuals.

The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the author's frustration is justified and that there needs to be more transparency and accountability in the digital marketing world. The most upvoted comment by user \"MarketingAffinity\" reads, \"Unfortunately, the digital marketing industry is filled with scammers who prey on unsuspecting business owners. Don't fall for their false promises and always do your own research before hiring anyone.\"",
