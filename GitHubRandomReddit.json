    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent, but the campaign only averaged one call every three days. Some positive points were identified, such as satisfactory results and a decent return on ad spend, but concerns were raised about the low frequency of calls and the need to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for different departments. Overall, commenters were satisfied with the results but expressed a desire for improvement and better targeting in future campaigns. The comment with the most upvotes was, \"I think keyword refinement and utilizing ad groups for different departments is a smart move. This way, you can target specific customer needs and increase the effectiveness of the campaign.\"",
