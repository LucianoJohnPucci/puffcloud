    "Title": "In the Reddit post about an artificial intelligence-based translator of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, commenters were largely positive about the potential of this technology. Some key positive points mentioned were the speed and accuracy of the translation process, as well as the ability to preserve and study ancient writings that would otherwise be inaccessible. Concerns primarily centered around the limitations of AI, such as potential errors and the lack of a human touch in understanding the cultural context of the hieroglyphs. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was hopeful and excited about the possibilities of this technology. The comment with the most upvotes (at the time of writing) was from user u/zaphod1911, who commented, \"As an Egyptologist myself, this is absolutely game-changing. Can't wait to see what else AI can help us uncover.\"",
