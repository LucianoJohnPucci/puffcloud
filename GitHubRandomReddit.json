    "Title": "This Reddit post features a small business owner who works over 70 hours a week and challenges the notion of \"passive\" small business ownership. While acknowledging the importance of hard work, the author argues that with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, small businesses can become less time-consuming through effective management through automation and delegation. Many commenters agree with this stance, pointing out that utilizing technology and delegating tasks can lead to a more efficient and ultimately, less demanding business. However, some express concerns over the potential financial cost of implementing such systems and the pressure to constantly be available and engaged in the business. Overall, the sentiment in the comments leans towards recognizing the potential for passive small business ownership, but also acknowledges the hard work and investment required to achieve it. The top upvoted comment emphasizes the importance of finding the right balance between working hard and utilizing technology and delegation to achieve success.",
