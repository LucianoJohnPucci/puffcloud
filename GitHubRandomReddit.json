    "Title": "This Reddit post features a college student seeking advice for their mother's struggling high-end women's clothing store. The store specializes in classy dresses for a \"mother of the bride\" audience but is facing low foot traffic and significant financial difficulties, leading the mother to consider bankruptcy. Despite 20 years of experience in the fashion industry and past successes, the new physical store is struggling. Many commenters suggest that the store's pricing range may be too high for its target audience and that offering discounts or promotions could attract more customers. Unique offerings such as custom dresses and jean resizing are seen as potential ways to stand out from competitors. The store's location in a high-income suburb is noted as a positive aspect, but some express concern that it may not be enough to sustain the business. The overall sentiment is sympathetic and supportive, with many offering practical suggestions and tips for overcoming the current challenges. The most upvoted comment suggests improving the store's online presence and creating a strong social media presence to attract a wider audience.",
