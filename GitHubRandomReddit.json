    "Title": "This Reddit post features a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature, which caused unexpected payment holds and \"enhanced due diligence\" despite the owner's successful and established business with no prior issues. The lack of clear communication from Stripe's support team has caused cash flow problems for the owner. The key positive points raised by commenters include their own success stories and appreciation for Stripe's overall services. However, the main concerns highlighted revolve around the lack of transparency and consistency in Stripe's RDR feature, causing frustration and financial difficulties for businesses. The overall sentiment of the commenters is negative, with many expressing disappointment and calling for improvements in Stripe's customer service and dispute resolution processes. The most upvoted comment suggests that the RDR feature may need to be fine-tuned and better communicated to businesses to avoid causing unexpected disruptions.",
