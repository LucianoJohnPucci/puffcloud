    "Title": "The post on Reddit discussed the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel, which outlines the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship through a simplified mathematical example. The example suggests using a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan to buy a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE). It predicts that by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. Many commenters pointed out the potential benefits of this strategy, such as low risk and high returns. However, there were also concerns raised about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and the specific niches that would fit this model. The overall sentiment seemed to be one of curiosity and interest, with some skepticism about the attainability of such consistent growth. One commenter with the most upvotes stated, \"Sounds like a solid strategy on paper, but execution and market factors can significantly impact the success of this approach.\"",
