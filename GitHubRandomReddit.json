    "Title": "In 2021, the author launched a smart pet tag business using NFC chips and QR codes, but despite significant investment and marketing, they have only sold 1,000 tags in two years. Commenters were generally positive about the idea, noting the convenience and potential market for the product. However, there were concerns about the price point and competition from similar products. Some suggested marketing to a niche market, such as dog trainers or pet breeders, while others thought implementing a subscription model or offering customization options could be beneficial. The overall sentiment was that the business has potential but may need to reevaluate its strategy before relaunching. The top-upvoted comment suggested reaching out to local pet shops or partnering with pet services for cross-promotion opportunities.",
