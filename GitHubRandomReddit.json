    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the author's plan to start a security business targeting small businesses, despite their limited budgets. The author is willing to offer competitive rates, such as $500 for 40 hours, even if it means operating at a loss initially. \n\nThe majority of commenters are supportive of the author's idea, praising their determination and willingness to adapt to the needs of small businesses. They believe that offering affordable rates will attract more clients and help the author's business grow in the long run. Some commenters also suggest targeting a niche market or offering additional services to differentiate from other security companies. \n\nHowever, some concerns are raised about the sustainability of operating at a loss and the potential struggle to increase rates in the future. Commenters also highlight the importance of considering the cost of materials and equipment, along with the author's time and effort, in setting their rates. They advise the author to carefully calculate their expenses and ensure that they are still profitable even with competitive rates. \n\nOverall, the sentiment of the commenters is positive and supportive, with some cautionary advice and suggestions sprinkled in. The most upvoted comment reinforces the idea of targeting a niche market and providing exceptional service, rather than just offering low rates.",
