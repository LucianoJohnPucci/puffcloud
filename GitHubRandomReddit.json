However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post details a frustrated customer's experience with a small business's return policy. Despite the business's guarantee of a 30-day return window and 100% satisfaction, the customer was charged $14 for shipping when they returned a $50 item that was not suitable. Due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed,\" it was sent back to the sender. The customer reached out for a refund, but the business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item back first, adding an extra $14 cost for the customer. Reddit commenters were generally critical of the business, with most expressing sympathy for the customer's situation and criticizing the business's lack of fairness in enforcing their return policy. The most upvoted comment called out the business for not standing by their return policy and potentially losing a customer for life.",
