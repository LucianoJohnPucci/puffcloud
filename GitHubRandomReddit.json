However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy. The business had advertised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but when the customer returned a $50 item that was not suitable, USPS marked it as \"unclaimed\" and it was returned to the sender. When the customer requested a refund, the business refused to cover the return shipping costs, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 expense. The main concern raised by commenters was the inconsistency between the advertised return policy and the business's actual actions, with many feeling that the business was not honoring its promise fairly. The overall sentiment of the commenters was frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The comment with the most upvotes expressed sympathy for the customer and criticized the business for not taking responsibility for the return shipping costs.",
