It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and inquires about specific small business niches that might fit this model.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which advocates for acquisition entrepreneurship by providing a simplified mathematical example. The example proposes buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) using a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. By growing the business revenue by 10% annually, it suggests that the business could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. The discussion overall had a positive sentiment, noting the potential benefits of this strategy such as leveraging a small initial investment for a large return and the ability to acquire a well-established business rather than starting from scratch. However, some commenters expressed doubts about the consistency of 10% growth over a decade and raised concerns about the specific industries or niches that would be suitable for this model. The most upvoted comment pointed out that this strategy may be more attainable for businesses with high growth potential in rapidly evolving industries such as technology or healthcare.",
