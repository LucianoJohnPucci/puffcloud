    "Title": "The Reddit post details a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature, which activates \"enhanced due diligence\" and puts a hold on payments, causing cash flow problems. Despite having a successful, established business, the owner is disappointed with the lack of clear communication from Stripe support and only receiving generic responses. Many commenters expressed positive experiences with Stripe's customer service and RDR feature, citing its effectiveness in preventing fraudulent chargebacks. However, a common concern was the lack of transparency and communication from Stripe when RDR is triggered, causing confusion and inconvenience for business owners. The sentiment of the commenters was generally mixed, with some praising Stripe for their fraud prevention measures and others criticizing their lack of communication and support. The top voted comment expressed frustration with Stripe's handling of the situation and called for better communication and understanding of their business from the company.",
