    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the commonly given advice to entrepreneurs that \"a good product will sell itself\" and asks for others' experiences with this misconception. The majority of commenters agree that this advice is misleading and stress the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement to successfully sell a product. They highlight the need for entrepreneurs to understand their target audience and actively promote their product through various channels. Concerns raised include the lack of understanding of proper marketing techniques leading to failure of even the best products, as well as the perpetuation of this misconception within the entrepreneurial community. The overall sentiment of the commenters is frustration with the misguided belief that a good product does not require any marketing efforts, and a call to dispel this myth. The most upvoted comment by user u/EntrepreneurialSuccess states, \"I have seen many great products fail due to poor marketing, and mediocre products succeed due to excellent marketing. It's a crucial aspect of entrepreneurship that should not be underestimated.\"",
