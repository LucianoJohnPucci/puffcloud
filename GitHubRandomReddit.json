    "Title": "In a popular Reddit post, a small business owner has challenged the misconception that owning a small business is a passive endeavor. Many commenters agree that while it may not require constant physical labor, it does involve strategic effort and focused attention. They suggest using systems, automation, and delegation to streamline tasks and free up time for high-leverage activities. However, some caution against completely neglecting the business, emphasizing the importance of staying involved and being aware of the day-to-day operations. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is that owning a small business requires hard work and the creation of a strong foundation, but can ultimately lead to a more fulfilling and potentially passive role in the long run. The most upvoted comment notes that true \"passive\" business ownership should involve strategic effort rather than complete neglect.",
