    "Title": "This Reddit post revolves around a handmade jewelry business owner seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a chain of small boutiques interested in carrying their products. The jeweler is unsure of what a reasonable margin is and is facing the challenge of producing high quantities for the first time, with the boutique owner requesting a minimum of 50 units of each design. The key positive points highlighted by commenters include the opportunity for the jewelry business to expand and reach a larger market, the potential for increased profits, and the fact that the boutique owner is interested in their products. However, concerns were raised about the potential loss of creative control, the need for a solid contract, and the importance of carefully calculating costs and expenses before negotiating a margin. Overall, the sentiment of commenters is one of cautious optimism, with many recommending the jeweler to carefully consider the terms and do their research before making a decision. The comment with the most upvotes was from a user suggesting negotiating a slightly higher margin and ensuring proper branding and credit is given to the jewelry business, to avoid being seen as simply a supplier to the boutique.",
