    "Title": "This Reddit post discussed a customer's experience with a small business that had a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee. The customer ordered a $50 item and returned it after realizing it was not suitable. However, due to issues with USPS, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The business refused to pay for return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing a refund, which would result in an additional $14 cost for the customer.

The overall sentiment of commenters was frustration towards the business and support for the customer. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"Not honoring a return policy is just bad business. As a customer, I would definitely consider a chargeback in this situation.\"",
