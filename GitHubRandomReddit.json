    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "On a recent Reddit post discussing a local sign business's Google Call Ads campaign, commenters generally found the results satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS) of $14.28 per call and a 57% conversion rate. The data showed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. However, there were some concerns raised about the average of one call every three days and the need for further keyword targeting and specific ad groups to improve campaign effectiveness. Overall, commenters had a positive sentiment and were optimistic about the future plans for the campaign. The most upvoted comment expressed the need for more information about the client's four departments in order to provide more targeted recommendations.",
