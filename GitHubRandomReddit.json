The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

The campaign spent $100 over 21 days, resulting in 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. These numbers indicate a successful campaign with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS). However, there are concerns about the low number of calls generated, averaging only one call every three days.

Most commenters agree that the results are satisfactory and that there is potential for improvement with better targeting and ad grouping. The overall sentiment is positive, with many commenters discussing their own experiences with Call Ads and offering valuable insights.
