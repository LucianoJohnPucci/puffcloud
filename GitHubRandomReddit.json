    "Title": "Many Redditors offered helpful and positive advice to a college student seeking help to improve the traffic and sales for their mother's high-end women's clothing store. The mother is an experienced fashion designer who has had past success selling through major outlets like Macy's and QVC, but has been struggling financially since opening a physical store a year ago, with low foot traffic and high production costs. The store offers unique products such as jeans with waist resizing features and custom dresses, and is located in a high-income suburb. Some key positive suggestions included expanding the store's online presence and social media marketing, hosting events and collaborations to attract more customers, and focusing on the specialized and unique products to set it apart from other stores.
