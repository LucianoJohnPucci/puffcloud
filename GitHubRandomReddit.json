    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the owner of a handmade jewelry business is asking for advice on negotiating a profit margin with the owner of a chain of small boutiques. The boutique owner is interested in carrying the handmade products but is requesting a minimum of 50 units of each design to stock all stores. The key positive points from the comments are that the jeweler should take advantage of this opportunity as it could lead to increased exposure and sales. Many commenters also suggest that the jeweler considers the added costs of producing in higher quantities and sets a reasonable profit margin to ensure both parties benefit. However, the main concerns raised are that the jeweler needs to carefully calculate their costs and ensure that they are not sacrificing too much of their profit margin. Some commenters also suggest that the jeweler sets a minimum order quantity to protect their own business. The overall sentiment from the commenters is that this is a great opportunity for the jeweler, but they need to approach it carefully to ensure a fair and beneficial agreement. The top-rated comment says, \"It's important to have open and honest communication with the boutique owner and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Don't be afraid to negotiate and make sure you fully understand the added costs of producing in higher quantities.\"",
