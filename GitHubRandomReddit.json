Most commenters supported the author's focus on small businesses and acknowledged the challenges of operating at a loss initially. They suggested tactics such as targeting specific industries and offering discounted packages, as well as emphasizing the long-term benefits of security.

Despite this, the overall sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many encouraging the author to take the risk and emphasizing the importance of providing affordable security options for small businesses. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"It's great to see a focus on small businesses in the security industry. While it may be challenging at first, offering competitive rates can help attract clients and build a strong reputation for your business in the long run.\"",
