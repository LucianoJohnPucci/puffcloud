    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a customer's experience with a small business's return policy. The business offers a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after the customer returned the item, it was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS. The business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, resulting in an extra $14 cost for the customer. The main positive points raised by commenters include the importance of clear return policies and the need for businesses to honor them. Some also offer alternative solutions, such as providing a pre-paid return label or offering a store credit instead of a refund. The main concerns raised revolve around the inconvenience and added cost for the customer, as well as the potential harm to the business's reputation. The overall sentiment of commenters is one of frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment suggests that the business should have a better system in place to handle returns and should not make the customer pay for their mistake.",
