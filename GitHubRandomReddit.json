    "Title": "This Reddit thread revolves around a customer's experience with a small business and their return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after realizing it wasn't suitable, returned it at a cost of $14 for shipping. However, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and was returned to the sender. The customer requested a refund, but the business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. This has caused frustration and the customer is considering a chargeback. While many commenters commended the business for their return policy and customer service, they expressed concern over the lack of communication and understanding on the business's part in this situation. They also raised the issue of customer-centricity and whether the business was truly honoring their return policy. The overall sentiment is that while the business may have a good return policy, their handling of this specific case has left a negative impression on the customer and the community. The top comment, with the most upvotes, summarizes this sentiment: \"The business could have handled this better. They should have covered the return shipping or at least communicated better with the customer.\"",
