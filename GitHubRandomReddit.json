    "Title": "A business owner recently activated Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature, but instead triggered \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds, leading to disruptions in cash flow. Despite having a successful, established business with no issues, the owner is frustrated with the lack of clear communication from Stripe support, which only provided generic responses. However, commenters praised Stripe's RDR feature as a useful tool for resolving disputes quickly and efficiently. The main concerns raised were the sudden implementation of \"enhanced due diligence\" and the lack of proper communication and support from Stripe. The overall sentiment from commenters was mixed, with some sharing similar frustrations and others defending Stripe's actions as necessary for fraud prevention. The most upvoted comment highlights the need for better communication and transparency from Stripe in these situations.",
