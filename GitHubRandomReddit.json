The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days and yielded 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. This resulted in a conversion rate of 57% and a cost per call of $14.28, indicating buyer intent and a decent return on ad spend (ROAS). However, the campaign only generated one call every three days, which the commenters suggest could be improved by refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is positive, with many acknowledging the satisfactory results and offering suggestions for improvement. The top comment with the most upvotes suggests using manual bidding instead of automatic bidding to improve targeting and control costs.",
