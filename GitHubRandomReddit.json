    "Title": "The author of this Reddit post reflects on their experience running an online business for a year and expresses a sense of surrealism as they earn more money overnight through automation than they did in two weeks at their previous job. While they feel a sense of satisfaction with this success, they also experience discomfort knowing that their friends are still stuck in traditional 9-5 jobs while their automated systems do the work for them. This raises concerns about the fairness of the system and highlights the disparity between the author's situation and that of their friends. The overall sentiment among commenters is that while they applaud the author's success, they also recognize the privilege and inequality at play. The most upvoted comment stated, \"It's a clear example of how technology can drastically change the job market and widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.\"",
