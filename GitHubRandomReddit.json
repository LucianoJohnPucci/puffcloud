    "Title": "AI analysis experts reviewed a Reddit post where a customer had a negative experience with a small business regarding a return. The post mentioned that the customer was initially satisfied with the purchase but returned the item when it was not suitable, paying $14 for shipping. However, the item was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender after three delivery attempts. When the customer requested a refund, the business refused to cover the return shipping cost and insisted on receiving the item back. This resulted in the customer facing additional expenses and feeling frustrated and considering a chargeback. \n\nThe majority of commenters sympathized with the customer, highlighting the positive points of the seller's satisfaction guarantee and the customer's efforts to return the item. Many commenters also expressed concerns about the business not honoring its return policy and putting the burden on the customer. Some raised questions about the seller's responsibility to cover return shipping costs and whether it was fair to expect the customer to bear the cost of the return due to a shipping error. \n\nOverall, the sentiment of commenters was negative towards the business, with many feeling that the customer had not been treated fairly. The most upvoted comment echoed this sentiment, stating, \"It's clear that the business is not fulfilling its promise of a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee. The customer should not be expected to bear the cost of the return due to shipping errors.\"",
