    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the idea of small businesses as \"passive\" income streams, with the author, a small business owner, challenging this notion by stating that their business requires over 70 hours of work per week. They concede that with the right opportunities, systems, and skills in automation and delegation, a small business can require less time. However, the consensus among the commenters is that while proper systems and skills can reduce the workload, completely disengaging from a small business is not possible. Instead, the focus should be on high-leverage tasks. The main concerns raised include the potential burnout and high cost of hiring help, as well as the lack of control and passion over outsourced tasks. Overall, the commenters agree that owning a small business requires a significant amount of time and effort, but with effective strategies and delegation, it can become more manageable. The top upvoted comment emphasizes the importance of prioritizing tasks and delegating effectively in order to maintain a balance between work and personal life.",
