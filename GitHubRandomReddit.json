    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The business advertised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" for a $50 item, but when the customer returned the item after it was deemed unsuitable, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The business refused to pay for return shipping and insisted on receiving the item for a refund, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. Commenters acknowledged the challenges of small businesses, but also expressed disappointment in the lack of transparency and fairness in this situation. The overall sentiment is sympathetic towards the customer and critical of the business's handling of the situation.
