    "Title": "The discussion centers around a bakery owner who fell victim to fraud when a salesman redirected $6,000 of customer payments to his personal account. The owner has filed a police complaint and is looking for a systematic approach to prevent future fraudulent activities and improve transaction tracking, particularly for cash on delivery transactions. Many commenters highlight the importance of implementing stricter financial controls, such as dual authorizations for payments and regular audits. Others suggest using technology, like a centralized payment system, to track transactions and prevent unauthorized access. Concerns are also raised about the lack of employee background checks and the need for proper employee training on ethical practices. Overall, the sentiment is one of support for the owner and concern for the impact this type of fraud can have on small businesses. The top comment with the most upvotes suggests implementing a system where the salesman does not have direct access to customer payments.",
