    "Link": "The creator of **everm?e**, a digital locket primarily targeting the US and Canada, seeks feedback on their website and product presentation to improve low conversion rates (2 sales from 2.5k visitors). The product is unfamiliar and in a higher price segment, requiring customer education. Despite positive offline feedback (e.g., at LVMH Prize, Paris Fashion Week), online sales struggle. Limited ad spend ($400) on Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, and Pinterest has yielded minimal results, though influencer marketing shows promise but is slow and unscalable. Key concerns include unclear product communication, lack of size guides, insufficient videos, and potential confusion in the ordering process. Brutally honest feedback is requested to address issues and improve online sales. Collaboration offers are also welcomed.",

The overall sentiment is one of support and a desire to see the product succeed, with many offering suggestions and collaboration offers. The most upvoted comment brings attention to the website's lack of clarity in explaining the product and suggests improving this to increase conversions.",
