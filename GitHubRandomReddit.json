    "Title": "The author of a post on Reddit expresses frustration with unsolicited offers from self-proclaimed digital marketing experts, claiming to provide unnecessary services including SEO, website optimization, social media growth, and AI tools. Commenters largely agreed with the author, stating that many marketing companies use these tactics to prey on small businesses and that a reputable company would not need to cold call or spam email potential clients. Some mentioned the importance of having a strong online presence and investing in certain services, but overall, the sentiment was negative towards these questionable marketing tactics. The top upvoted comment states: \"Unfortunately, the world of marketing is filled with these types of companies. It's important to do your research and choose a reputable company that has proven results, rather than falling for quick-fix promises.\"",
