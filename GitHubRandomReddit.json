    "Title": "The Reddit post in question discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering \"enhanced due diligence\" and causing payment holds, despite having a successful business with no issues. The owner is disappointed with the lack of clear communication from Stripe support, which only provided generic responses and has caused cash flow problems for their business. Despite being a valued customer, the owner's concerns were not addressed adequately by Stripe, leading to a negative experience with the company's customer service. However, many commenters point out the need for companies like Stripe to have strict fraud prevention measures, leading to a consensus that while the RDR feature may be inconvenient, it is necessary for the security of the business and its customers. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some expressing sympathy for the business owner's situation while others support Stripe's actions in ensuring the safety of their platform. The most upvoted comment notes the importance of transparency and providing clear explanations in such situations.",
