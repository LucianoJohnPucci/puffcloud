After successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. The customer insisted on net 60 payments, which the owner found untenable due to the upfront costs of custom work. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still risky for the owner. Ultimately, the owner chose not to proceed with the order, prioritizing peace of mind over financial risk. They sought to hear from others about similar experiences with large companies.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post generated a discussion on a small UK engineering company's difficulties in dealing with an overseas customer in the UAE. Despite successful agreement on specifications for a custom product, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. While the customer insisted on net 60 payments, the owner found this unfeasible due to upfront costs. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still deemed risky by the owner who ultimately chose not to proceed with the order. The community shared similar experiences with larger companies and expressed concerns over unfair payment practices and the challenges faced by small businesses when dealing with larger clients. While some commenters shared positive experiences and offered advice on how to navigate such situations, the overall sentiment was one of frustration and understanding towards the owner's decision to prioritize their financial stability over potential profits. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the need for small businesses to protect themselves and consider all factors before agreeing to deals with larger companies.",
