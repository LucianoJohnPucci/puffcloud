    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shares their frustration with a small business after experiencing issues with a return. The customer was promised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after returning the $50 item and paying $14 for shipping, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing a refund, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. While some commenters praised the business for their generous return policy and encouraged the customer to give them a chance to resolve the issue, the main concerns raised were the lack of communication and fairness in honoring the return policy. Commenters expressed frustration with the additional costs and suggested the customer consider a chargeback. The overall sentiment was negative, with many feeling disappointed and misled by the business's actions. The top-voted comment was from a user who suggested the customer contact the business one more time before initiating a chargeback.",
