    "Title": "This Reddit post challenges the idea that small businesses can be \"passive\" income streams. The author, a small business owner, acknowledges that with the right opportunities, systems, and skills in automation and delegation, a small business can require less time. However, they clarify that this doesn't mean complete disengagement and instead involves focusing on high-leverage tasks while still putting in over 70 hours of work per week. The discussion includes various positive points, such as the potential for growth and flexibility, but the main concerns raised revolve around the difficulty of achieving true automation and delegation and the risks and challenges involved in owning a small business. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters seems to be mixed, with some agreeing with the author's point and others expressing skepticism and caution. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the value of finding a good business partner who can help share the workload and contribute to the success of the business.",
