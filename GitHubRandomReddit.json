    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shares their frustration with a small business that refused to cover the return shipping cost for a $50 item, despite advertising a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" The customer had paid $14 for shipping when they returned the item, but due to multiple delivery attempts by USPS, it was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. Now, the customer is facing an additional $14 cost and is considering a chargeback. The discussion in the comments largely centers around the fairness of the business's return policy and whether they are truly honoring it. Many commenters praised the customer for trying to resolve the issue directly with the business before considering a chargeback, while others expressed disappointment in the business's unreasonable stance on the return shipping cost. The overall sentiment is one of support for the customer and criticism towards the business for not honoring their advertised return policy. The most upvoted comment highlights the issue with the business's stance, stating: \"If they're gonna advertise a return policy, they better damn well honor it without putting the customer through even more hassle.\"",
