However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business's return policy is under scrutiny after a customer's $50 item was returned due to being unsuitable. The business's policy of a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" has received praise from some commenters, highlighting the positive aspects of the policy in promoting customer satisfaction. However, the main issue raised by commenters is the business's refusal to cover the return shipping cost of $14, despite the customer already paying for shipping when they first ordered the item. This has resulted in frustration for the customer, who is now facing additional costs if they want to receive a refund. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business is not honoring their return policy fairly, and some are even considering a chargeback. The comment with the most upvotes expresses disappointment in the business's lack of accountability and suggests that they should cover all return shipping costs to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty.",
