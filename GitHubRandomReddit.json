    "Link": "In Spring 2017, a college student began trading Steam skins with a small investment, eventually developing a trading site for Rust with the help of a programmer, Michel. By the end of 2017, the business had grown significantly, reaching 16,000 users and generating $1,100 monthly profit. However, by Winter 2018, profits declined due to marketing challenges and increased expenses. After ceasing development to focus on school, the owner sold 90% of the site for $2,200 in Spring 2019. Key takeaways include learning about development, marketing, and entrepreneurship, and ultimately withdrawing over $12,000 in profits from initial investments. The experience fostered a newfound interest in the business world.",

    "Title": "In Spring 2017, a college student entered the world of trading by investing in Steam skins. With the assistance of a programmer, the student developed a trading site for Rust, which grew to 16,000 users and generated a monthly profit of $1,100 by the end of the year. However, the business faced challenges in marketing and expenses, leading to a decline in profits by Winter 2018. The owner then chose to focus on school and sold 90% of the site for $2,200 in Spring 2019. The experience taught the student about development, marketing, and entrepreneurship, resulting in a total profit of over $12,000 from the initial investments. While commenters expressed appreciation for the valuable lessons learned, they also raised concerns about the owner's decision to prioritize school over the business and the relatively low selling price of the site. Overall, the sentiment was positive with some cautionary notes about balancing academics and entrepreneurship. The top upvoted comment stated, \"It's great that you took a risk and learned important skills, but don't neglect your education for it.\"",
