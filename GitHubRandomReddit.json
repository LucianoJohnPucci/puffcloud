It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years.

    "Title": "In the Reddit post, users are discussing the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship by using Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" as a basis. The book presents a simplified example of buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), utilizing a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example suggests that by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. Many commenters found this example to be encouraging and achievable, highlighting the potential for financial success and wealth creation. However, others raised concerns about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and questioned the feasibility in specific small business niches. Overall, the sentiment among commenters was mixed, with some expressing enthusiasm and others expressing skepticism about the model. One comment with the most upvotes reads, \"While the example may seem promising, it's important to consider the complexities and challenges that come with acquiring and growing a business. It's not as simple as it seems, and investors should carefully evaluate their options before jumping into this strategy.\"",
