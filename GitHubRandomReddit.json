    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, a writer voiced their concern about an increase in Stripe payment processor horror stories, where small businesses are facing frozen funds, requests for enhanced due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\". The main positive points highlighted by commenters include the convenience and ease of use of Stripe for businesses, as well as the reliability of the payment platform itself. However, the main concern raised is the seemingly excessive control and power that payment processors, such as Stripe, have over small businesses. Many commenters shared their own personal experiences with frozen funds and frustrating interactions with Stripe's customer service team, expressing their worry about the impact on their business. The overall sentiment of the commenters leans towards frustration and distrust towards payment processors, with some calling for stricter regulations to prevent these types of situations. The most upvoted comment stated, \"I agree that there needs to be a balance between security and customer service. Payment processors hold a lot of power and it's important that small businesses are not taken advantage of.\"",
