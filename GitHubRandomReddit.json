    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering \"enhanced due diligence\" and causing payment holds despite a successful business with no issues. While many commenters praise RDR for its effectiveness in protecting against fraudulent chargebacks, they also express concerns about the lack of clear communication from Stripe support and the negative impact on cash flow. The overall sentiment is that while RDR is a good concept, it needs to be implemented more efficiently to avoid these issues. The most upvoted comment suggests that Stripe should provide better communication and transparency to merchants using RDR.",
