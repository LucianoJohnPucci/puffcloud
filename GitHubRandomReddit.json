    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a customer who ordered a $50 item from a small business with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee. After returning the item and paying $14 for shipping, USPS marked the package as unclaimed and returned it to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost and considering a chargeback. While some commenters praised the business for having a clear return policy, many expressed concern over the lack of customer service and fairness in not covering the return shipping cost. The overall sentiment of the commenters was frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment states, \"This is terrible customer service. The business should honor their return policy and cover the return shipping cost, especially since the package was marked as unclaimed through no fault of the customer.\"",
