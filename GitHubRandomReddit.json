    "Title": "The author of the post began their business in 2007 after spending 18 years at a failing company, utilizing their 22 years of experience and strong client relationships. They were able to work from home and dodge high real estate costs, and even survived the 2008 crash. However, COVID-19 proved to be a huge challenge, especially with a 50% increase in operating costs in 2020. As a result, they are considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor, admitting they were lucky not to have closed like many other small businesses in 2020.
