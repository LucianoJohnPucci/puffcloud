    "Title": "The majority of commenters on the Reddit post expressed skepticism towards the suppliers' claims of an 80% increase in aluminum prices due to tariffs and industry pricing restrictions. Many pointed out that such a drastic increase was unlikely, with a few citing personal experience or industry knowledge to support their doubts. Some suggested that the suppliers may be using the tariffs as an excuse to inflate prices and boost profits. Several commenters also highlighted the lack of transparency and communication from the suppliers, calling for the small business owner to seek quotes from other suppliers to compare prices. The overall sentiment was one of suspicion and caution, with one commenter receiving the most upvotes for suggesting the owner look at the market price of aluminum and negotiate with suppliers based on that information.",
