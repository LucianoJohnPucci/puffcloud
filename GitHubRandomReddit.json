    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, the author draws attention to the struggling state of small businesses and investigates which industries are experiencing growth and profitability. Many commenters agree that construction and tradespeople seem to be doing better recently. They highlight key positive points such as the increased demand for home renovations and repairs due to the pandemic, which has brought job opportunities for these industries. However, the main concern raised is that this growth may not be sustainable in the long run, as the pandemic is not expected to last forever. Some also argue that other industries, such as technology and healthcare, are also experiencing growth, but may not be as visible or accessible. Overall, commenters have a cautiously optimistic sentiment, acknowledging the potential for growth in construction and trades but also acknowledging the uncertainty and the need for support for all struggling businesses. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"I'm glad to see some industries are doing well, but let's not forget about the small businesses that are still struggling and need support.\"",
