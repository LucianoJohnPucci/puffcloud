    "Title": "In 2024, a Redditor shared their excitement about launching their own clothing brand after years of dreaming. They started by selling their dresses on Meesho, but faced issues with lost returns and later switched to Amazon. However, they have yet to receive any orders and are now feeling overwhelmed with fear about potential failures, such as poor sales and product reception. Other commenters shared positive points such as the joy of seeing their own creations come to life, the importance of understanding customers' needs, and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges. However, they also expressed concerns about managing finances, standing out in a saturated market, and the impacts of negative feedback. The overall sentiment of the commenters was supportive and motivating, acknowledging the difficulties of starting a business but encouraging the OP to stay determined and learn from any mistakes. The most upvoted comment read, \"Don't let the fear of failure hold you back. Embrace it as a learning opportunity and keep moving forward.\"",
