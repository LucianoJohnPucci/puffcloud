    "Title": "A customer shared their experience on Reddit, where they ordered a $50 item from a small business that offered a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After returning the item and paying $14 for shipping, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and it was returned to the sender. Unfortunately, the business refused to cover the return shipping cost and insisted on receiving the item before processing a refund, leaving the customer with an additional $14 charge. Many commenters expressed frustration with the business's handling of the return, feeling that they were not honoring their return policy fairly. Some pointed out that the customer had followed all necessary steps and should not be responsible for the return shipping cost. The overall sentiment of the comments was negative, with many saying they would reconsider supporting the business in the future. The top-voted comment stated, \"If a business has a return policy, they should honor it fully, including covering return shipping costs. Otherwise, it's false advertising.\"",
