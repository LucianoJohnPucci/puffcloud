However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post in question shares a customer's frustration with a small business that did not honor its advertised return policy. The majority of commenters expressed disappointment with the business's actions, highlighting the importance of transparency and accountability in customer service. Some noted positive experiences with other small businesses that went above and beyond to provide hassle-free returns. The main concerns raised were the business's lack of empathy and its insistence on receiving the item back before issuing a refund, despite the customer already incurring shipping costs. This, along with the delay in processing the refund, could potentially lead to the customer resorting to a chargeback. The overall sentiment is that the business's behavior is unfair and unprofessional. The top-rated comment expresses frustration with the business's unwillingness to take responsibility, stating, \"If you advertise a 30-day return policy, you shouldn't make it difficult for customers to actually return items.\"",
