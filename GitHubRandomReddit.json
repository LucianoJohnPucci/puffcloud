    "Title": "In a Reddit post, the author reflects on their experience running an online business for a year and expresses a sense of surrealism as their automated systems generate more money overnight than their previous job did in two weeks. Many commenters agreed that this was a positive and impressive achievement, praising the author's hard work and success. However, several concerns were raised about the fairness of the system, as the author's friends are stuck in traditional 9-5 jobs while their automated systems generate income with minimal effort. This highlights the disparity between those who have access to and knowledge of automated systems and those who don't. The overall sentiment of the commenters is a mix of admiration for the author's success, but also discomfort and questioning of the fairness of the system they operate in. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"It's great that you are achieving such success, but it definitely makes you question the larger societal issues at play when some are able to make easy money while others struggle with traditional jobs.\"",
