    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's experience with a small business that offered a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee. The customer ordered a $50 item but realized it wasn't suitable and returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and it was returned to the sender after three delivery attempts. The customer reached out for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing the refund, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. The main positive points raised by commenters include the importance of honoring return policies, the frustration of the customer's experience, and the potential for a chargeback if the business doesn't rectify the situation. Key concerns raised include the business's lack of transparency regarding their return policy and the inconvenience and financial burden placed on the customer due to the return shipping costs. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the way the business handled the situation. The most upvoted comment suggests that the business should have covered the return shipping costs as a goodwill gesture to maintain customer satisfaction.",
