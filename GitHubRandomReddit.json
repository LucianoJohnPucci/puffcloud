    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post evaluates a local sign business's recent Google Call Ads campaign, which spent $100 over 21 days and resulted in 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. With a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, it is clear that the campaign generated a decent return on ad spend (ROAS). However, commenters had mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the campaign, with some pointing out the low frequency of calls (averaging one call every three days). Suggestions for improvement included refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. The overall sentiment among commenters was that the campaign showed promise but could be optimized further. The most upvoted comment, with 56 upvotes, emphasized the importance of refining keywords for better targeting.",
