    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the challenges faced by a small UK engineering company when trying to fulfill a custom product order from a large overseas customer in the UAE. Despite successfully agreeing on specifications, the two parties struggled with payment terms, with the customer insisting on net 60 payments, which the owner found risky due to upfront costs. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still considered as a financial risk. The owner ultimately decided to prioritize peace of mind over the potential financial risk and declined the order. Many commenters shared similar experiences with large companies imposing unreasonable payment terms, while others praised the owner for standing their ground and putting their business first. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the importance of setting clear payment terms from the beginning and not being afraid to walk away from a potentially troublesome client.",
