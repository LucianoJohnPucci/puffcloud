    "Title": "The Reddit post prompts a discussion on the commonly held belief that \"a good product will sell itself\" and how this advice often leads to the neglect of effective marketing strategies and online engagement. Commenters highlight the importance of having a quality product and the need for a strong marketing plan to support its success. They bring attention to the misconception that a good product can succeed without any effort, emphasizing the importance of actively selling and promoting to reach target audiences. Some shared their own experiences where they witnessed the failure of products that were solely relying on their quality to sell. Despite acknowledging the value of a good product, the overall sentiment among commenters is that effective marketing strategies and online engagement are crucial for success. The most upvoted comment echoes this sentiment by stating, \"A product might sell itself for a limited time, but sustainable success requires effective marketing to continuously attract and retain customers.\"",
