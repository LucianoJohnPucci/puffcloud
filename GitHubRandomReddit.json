    "Title": "The Reddit post shares a common misconception among entrepreneurs that a good product will automatically sell itself, and requests for input on similar experiences. Many commenters agreed that having a strong marketing strategy and online presence is crucial for the success of a product, and shared their own experiences of having a great product that failed due to lack of effective marketing. Others emphasized the importance of word-of-mouth and customer satisfaction as key elements for a product to truly sell itself. Concerns were raised regarding the potential oversaturation of the market with similar products, and the need to constantly innovate and adapt to changing consumer needs. While some felt discouraged by this notion, others saw it as an opportunity to stand out and truly create a buzz around their product. The overall sentiment was that while having a good product is important, it is not enough and entrepreneurs need to have a well-rounded approach to marketing and customer engagement. The comment with the most upvotes echoed this sentiment, stating \"A good product is only one part of the equation, you need to be able to effectively market it and create a strong brand presence online to truly make it sell.\"",
