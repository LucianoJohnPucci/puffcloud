    "Title": "The Reddit post reviewed Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build\" and the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship. The scenario presented is an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to increase revenue by 10% annually and sell the business for $3-4M in ten years. The overall sentiment of the comments is mixed, with some pointing out the potential benefits of acquiring an established business, such as existing infrastructure and customers, while others express skepticism about consistently achieving 10% growth over a decade. Concerns are also raised about the potential risks of taking on a large SBA loan and the need for a solid business plan. Some suggest targeting niche markets or industries with potential for long-term growth to support the projected growth rate. The top-upvoted comment highlights the importance of carefully evaluating the business, market trends, and potential competition before making such a significant investment.",
