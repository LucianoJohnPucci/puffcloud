    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit discussion on a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business generated a mix of positive and critical opinions. The campaign spent $100 over 21 days and yielded a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of the callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. However, some commenters expressed concern over the low frequency of calls, with only one call every three days. This raised questions about the effectiveness of the campaign and the need for refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. Despite these concerns, many commenters noted the satisfactory return on ad spend (ROAS) and the potential for improvement in future campaigns. The most upvoted comment emphasized the importance of continued optimization and experimentation to achieve better results.",
