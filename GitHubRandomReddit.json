    "Title": "This Reddit post reflects on the author's experience of running an online business for a year and their sense of surrealism as they earn more money overnight from automation than in two weeks at their previous job. The post expresses a mix of satisfaction and discomfort, as the author's friends work traditional 9-5 jobs while their automated systems generate income with minimal effort. Some commenters pointed out the positives of automation, such as the freedom it provides and the potential to scale businesses quickly. However, many raised concerns about the fairness of the system and the disparity between those who have access to automation and those who do not. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be a mix of admiration for the author's success and a recognition of the unfairness of the system. The most upvoted comment reads, \"While automation can bring great success, it's important to also consider its impact on society and strive for a more equitable distribution of wealth.\"",
