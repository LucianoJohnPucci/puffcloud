    "Title": "In a Reddit post, a customer shared their experience of returning a $50 item to a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" The customer paid $14 for shipping, but the item was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender by USPS after three delivery attempts. The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing a refund, adding an additional $14 cost for the customer. The post generated many comments, with some praising the business for having a return policy in the first place and others criticizing their handling of the situation. The main concern raised was the added cost incurred by the customer and the frustration with the business for not honoring their return policy fairly. The overall sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some showing empathy towards the business and understanding their perspective, while others sided with the customer and felt the business's actions were unfair. One of the top comments with the most upvotes highlighted the importance of clear and transparent return policies for small businesses to maintain customer satisfaction.",
