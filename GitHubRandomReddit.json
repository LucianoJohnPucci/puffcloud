    "Title": "There is growing concern among US shoppers and small business owners over the increased import duties and processing fees imposed by UPS and DHL. Many are experiencing additional costs of $20 to over $50 per shipment, resulting in some individuals and companies halting US orders. While some commenters acknowledge the need for these fees to cover the costs of shipping and handling, others argue that these charges are excessive and unfairly burdening consumers and small businesses. The overall sentiment in the discussion is one of frustration and disappointment, with many expressing the need for more transparency and fair pricing from these shipping companies. The top comment with the most upvotes reads: \"As a small business owner, these added costs are really impacting my bottom line. It's unfair that we're being hit with such high fees while giant corporations get subsidized shipping rates.\"",
