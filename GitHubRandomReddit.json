    "Title": "The Reddit post reviewed discussed the author's experience with running an online business for a year, where they express a sense of surrealism as they earn more money overnight from automation than in two weeks at their previous job. The commenters seemed to agree that this is a positive thing, as it shows the potential of automated systems to create income with minimal effort. However, this also raises concerns about the fairness of the system, as the author's friends are still working traditional 9-5 jobs. The overall sentiment of the commenters can be described as a mix of amazement and discomfort, as they admire the efficiency of automation but also question the societal implications of this disparity. The comment with the most upvotes echoes this sentiment, stating, \"It's amazing to see how far technology has come, but it's also concerning to see the growing gap between those who have access to it and those who don't.\"",
