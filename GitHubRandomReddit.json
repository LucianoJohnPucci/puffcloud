    "Title": "This Reddit post reflects on the author's experience running an online business for a year, where they express a sense of surrealism as they earn more money overnight from automation than in two weeks at their previous job. The key positive points highlighted by commenters include the satisfaction and success that comes with the author's automated systems generating income with minimal ongoing effort. However, this success is also accompanied by discomfort and a questioning of the fairness of the system, as the author's friends are working traditional 9-5 jobs while they are able to earn passive income. This raises concerns about the disparity between the author's situation and that of their friends, and the overall sentiment of commenters is mixed, with some applauding the author's success and others sympathizing with their friends' struggles. The most upvoted comment reads, \"It's the nature of capitalism, but it's also about finding ways to make it work for you. Congrats on your success!\"",
