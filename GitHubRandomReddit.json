    "Title": "The topic of artificial intelligence (AI) losing hype is a popular and important discussion among the vfx community. Many commenters agree that AI is still a valuable tool in the industry, particularly in tasks that are tedious or time-consuming. Some also point out its potential to revolutionize the creative process. However, others express concerns about AI taking away jobs and the ethical implications of creating \"perfect\" digital humans. The overall sentiment seems to be one of cautious optimism, with many expressing the need for humans to remain a crucial part of the creative process. The comment with the most upvotes comes from user u/razgriz-core, who asserts that AI should not be seen as a replacement for artists, but rather as a complementary tool in their artistic toolbox.",
