However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit community discussed a customer who ordered a $50 item from a small business with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee. However, after returning the item and paying $14 for shipping, it was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The customer requested a refund, but the business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item first, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. Positively, some commenters praised the business for offering a 100% satisfaction guarantee and emphasized the importance of reading return policies carefully. They also highlighted the potential challenges small businesses face in covering return shipping costs. However, the main concern raised was fairness and customer service, with many feeling that the business should have covered the return shipping given the circumstances. The overall sentiment was frustration and disappointment with some even suggesting a chargeback. The most upvoted comment expressed disappointment with the business's actions and urged them to consider the impact on the customer and their reputation.",
