The tool has been effective for the author and they are now considering offering it as a service to others, seeking advice on which niches would benefit the most and how to approach potential clients without triggering Facebook's detection systems.

Some suggested niche options such as e-commerce, local businesses, and coaches, while others suggested approaching clients through word-of-mouth or by showcasing real, successful results. The overall sentiment was divided, with some seeing potential benefits and others warning against the potential negative consequences. The top-upvoted comment called for further consideration of the impact on small businesses and the potential consequences of using such a tool on a larger scale.",
