    "Title": "The author of the Reddit post reveals their journey of starting their business in 2007 after 18 years at a failing company and leveraging their 22 years of experience and client loyalty. They were able to keep costs low by working from home and survived the 2008 crash, but the current COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs (up 50% in 2020) have made their business unsustainable. Despite their struggles, they consider themselves fortunate to still be standing unlike many other small businesses that have closed in 2020. The commenters praise the author's determination and resilience in keeping their business afloat for over a decade. They also commend their smart decision of working from home to cut real estate costs. However, many express concerns about the current situation and offer advice on exploring other opportunities, such as a part-time 1099 contract. The overall sentiment of the commenters is empathetic and supportive, with many sharing their own struggles as small business owners. The top upvoted comment suggests the author look into pivoting their business to adapt to the changing market.",
