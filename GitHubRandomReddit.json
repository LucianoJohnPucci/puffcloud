The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The discussion on Reddit focused on the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business. The campaign had a budget of $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. Many commenters viewed the results as satisfactory, with a good return on ad spend, but some expressed concerns about the low call volume, averaging only one call every three days. The future plans discussed included refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve overall campaign effectiveness. The overall sentiment of the commenters was positive, with most acknowledging the value of the campaign and offering constructive feedback for future improvements. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the need for targeted ad groups to better cater to the client's specific departments.",
