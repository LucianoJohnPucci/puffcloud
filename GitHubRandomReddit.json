    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a suspicion of fake threads being posted on the smallbusiness subreddit, specifically involving a solution called Wosily. The top comments always mention Wosily and are posted by new accounts with fake post histories, leading the user to suggest banning all mentions of Wosily and implementing measures to prevent fake threads. Many commenters agree with this suggestion, as they have also noticed the suspicious patterns and the negative impact they have on the subreddit's credibility. Concerns are raised about the lack of moderation and measures in place to prevent these fake threads from flooding the subreddit. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is frustration and disappointment with the situation. \n\nTop Comment:\n\"I've noticed this as well and it's incredibly frustrating. It's clear that these are fake threads meant to promote Wosily and it's unsurprising that they are quickly deleted once called out. This type of behavior should not be tolerated and the mods need to take action to prevent it from happening.\" - u/Mandos_Ahriman",
