They worked from home, avoiding real estate costs, and survived the 2008 crash. Both the author and their husband are self-employed. Despite enduring the COVID-19 pandemic, rising costs (up 50% in 2020) made the business unsustainable.

    "Title": "The author of the post shared their experience of starting a successful business in 2007 after 18 years at a failing company, using their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to thrive. They also mention their savvy decision to work from home, avoiding real estate costs and surviving the 2008 crash. However, despite their determination, their business has become unsustainable due to rising costs in 2020 (increasing by 50%). The author and their spouse are both self-employed and have been fortunate to not close during the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike many others. Some positive points mentioned by commenters include the author's use of their experience and client loyalty to build a successful business, as well as their smart decision to work from home. One concern raised is the steep increase in costs that have made their business unsustainable. The overall sentiment of commenters is sympathetic, with many offering words of encouragement and suggestions for alternative options. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of being resilient and adapting to changing circumstances in order to survive as a small business owner.",
