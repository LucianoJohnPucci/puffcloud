While some commenters defend the statement, others offer counterarguments and raise concerns.

However, concerns were raised about the adequacy of the CEO's statement and the limitations of PC gaming, such as the high cost of entry and potential compatibility issues. The overall sentiment of the commenters leans towards disagreement with the CEO's statement and an appreciation for the flexibility and complexity of PC gaming. The most upvoted comment, with 472 upvotes, states: \"PC gaming is like cooking. If you prepare it correctly with the right ingredients, it can be better than any ready-made TV dinner. But that takes some know-how and effort.\"",
