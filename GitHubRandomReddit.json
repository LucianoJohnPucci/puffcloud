    "Title": "In Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" he proposes a potential strategy for acquisition entrepreneurship by purchasing a $1.5M revenue, $200K SDE business for $1M with a personal investment of $100K and a 90% SBA loan. He suggests that with 10% annual growth, the business could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. The post sparked a discussion among Reddit users with majority highlighting the potential for growth and return on investment through this approach. The idea of leveraging an SBA loan also generated positive feedback. However, some commenters raised concerns about the sustainability of 10% annual growth for a decade and the practicality of replicating this success in different business niches. Ultimately, the sentiment of the commenters was optimistic and curious, seeking insights and real-world examples of small business niches that could achieve this level of growth. The most upvoted comment was from user u/AbbyNormal2, who shared a personal experience of successfully growing a small business by more than 10% annually through strategic partnerships and diversifying revenue streams.",
