    "Title": "In a Reddit post about a business that started in 2007 after the owner spent 18 years at a failing company, commenters had a lot to say. The author leveraged 22 years of experience and client loyalty to start their business and avoided real estate costs by working from home, surviving the 2008 crash. The author and their husband are both self-employed and despite enduring the COVID-19 pandemic, rising costs (up 50% in 2020) have made the business unsustainable. They are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor, acknowledging they were fortunate not to close in 2020 like many other small businesses. While some commenters praised the author's perseverance and resilience, others expressed concern about the long-term sustainability of the business and offered suggestions for alternative revenue streams. The overall sentiment was sympathetic and positive, with many commenters wishing the author success in their future endeavors. The comment with the most upvotes was a well-wish from a fellow small business owner who empathized with the author's struggles and encouraged them to keep pushing forward.",
