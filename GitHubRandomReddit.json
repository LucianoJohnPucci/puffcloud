    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author is discussing the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship presented in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build\". The scenario involves an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and financing the rest through a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. While some commenters see potential for success in this approach, others raise concerns about the feasibility of achieving a consistent 10% growth rate over a decade and question which business niches could support this growth. The overall sentiment is mixed, with some highlighting the benefits of leveraging SBA loans and others expressing doubt about the long-term success of the strategy. The top-rated comment points out that the success of this approach largely depends on the entrepreneur's ability to effectively manage and grow the business.",
