However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The discussion on this Reddit post revolves around a customer who ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\", but faced challenges when trying to return it. Many commenters praise the business for having a return policy in place, which is not always the case with small businesses. However, the main concern raised is that the business is not fully honoring their return policy, as the customer was charged $14 for shipping and the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned. This resulted in the customer facing an additional $14 cost to return the item, which they feel is unfair. The overall sentiment is frustration and disappointment with the business for not handling the situation in a customer-friendly manner. The most upvoted comment states that the business should have provided a prepaid label for the return, as it is their responsibility to ensure customer satisfaction.",
