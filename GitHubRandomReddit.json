Some key positive points mentioned by commenters include the potential to diversify their product line and target new markets, as well as the possibility of negotiating better prices with suppliers. However, many commenters raise concerns about the overall negative impact of tariffs on global trade and the potential for increased costs for both businesses and consumers. The general sentiment among commenters is one of frustration and uncertainty, with some expressing the need for better government policies and others suggesting alternative strategies such as finding new suppliers or shifting to domestic production.
