    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the user discusses their product's gross profit of 25% and their approach to managing finances for their business. Some key positive points mentioned by commenters include the importance of maintaining a separate business checking/savings account and credit card, as it helps to keep personal and business finances separate and organized. The user's consideration of book recommendations to learn more about financial management for their business is also seen as a proactive step. However, the main concern raised by commenters is the uncertainty surrounding how frequently to pay themselves, given that the business has not yet launched. Some suggest setting a salary based on the projected profits, while others advise adjusting payments as the business grows. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is generally positive, with many offering helpful advice and sharing their own experiences. The top comment with the most upvotes comes from a commenter recommending the book \"Profit First\" by Mike Michalowicz as a valuable resource for financial management for small businesses.",
