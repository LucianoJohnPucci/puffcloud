    "Title": "A heated discussion on a Reddit post covers a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The business promised a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but when the customer returned the unsuitable $50 item, they were charged $14 for shipping. However, USPS unable to deliver the package stamped it as \"unclaimed\" and sent it back to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping fee and required the item's physical return to process the refund, causing the customer an additional $14 expense. The main concerns raised by commenters include the business's lack of transparency and unfairness in its return policy. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business is not honoring its promises, and the customer should resort to a chargeback. The top upvoted comment states, \"It should be on the business to pay for the return shipping. That's just good customer service.\"",
