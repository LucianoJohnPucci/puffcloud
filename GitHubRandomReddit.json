    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The business advertised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after returning a $50 item, the customer was charged $14 for shipping when USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed.\" The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, leaving the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Commenters praised the customer for following the return policy and expressed frustration with the business's approach. Many pointed out that the business should have covered the return shipping since it was clearly stated in their policy. Overall, the sentiment was negative towards the business's actions, with one commenter stating, \"This is terrible customer service.\" The most-upvoted comment was \"This business needs to honor their guarantee and cover the return shipping. It's only fair.\"",
