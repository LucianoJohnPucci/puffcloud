The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls with a $100 budget over 21 days. The post highlights the campaign's success with a cost per call of $14.28 and a high conversion rate of 57%, indicating strong buyer intent. However, commenters raised concerns about the relatively low number of calls, with one calling it unsatisfactory that only one call was generated every three days. They suggested refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve the campaign's effectiveness. The overall sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many expressing interest in the campaign's potential and offering helpful suggestions for improvement. The top upvoted comment stated, \"It's great that the campaign yielded a decent return on ad spend and showed strong buyer intent, but there is room for improvement in terms of increasing the number of calls. Refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups could potentially be the solution.\"",
