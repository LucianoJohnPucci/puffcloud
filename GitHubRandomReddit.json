    "Title": "In a recent post on Reddit, an author shares their experience as a member of an entrepreneur group that focuses on fast growth and investor funding. However, the author personally prefers stable growth and self-funding for their business and values work-life balance. While they shared their business approach, they were met with criticism for not working enough. The author remains determined to continue their business journey without the support of the entrepreneur group, despite feeling hurt by the comments. The overall sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some expressing understanding and support for the author's goals, while others criticized their approach. Many praised the author for prioritizing work-life balance and cautioned against the detrimental effects of burnout. However, others raised concerns about the practicality and feasibility of long-term self-funding and the potential for missed opportunities without investor support. One comment that stood out with the most upvotes was: \"Your business should support your lifestyle, not the other way around. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for choosing a path that allows you to balance work and life.\"",
