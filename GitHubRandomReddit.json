Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the author discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship presented in Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build.\" The hypothetical example introduced involves an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with a $100K investment and a 90% SBA loan, projecting a 10% annual revenue growth and a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The post sparked a discussion on the realism of achieving consistent 10% growth and potential niches that could achieve this trajectory. Many commenters pointed out that while the concept is intriguing, achieving 10% growth every year may not be realistic and the success of the acquisition would heavily depend on the industry and market conditions. Some suggested that focusing on a specific niche, such as a growing industry or a unique market, could increase the chances of achieving this growth. Nonetheless, the overall sentiment of the commenters seemed to be positive, with many acknowledging the potential of acquisition entrepreneurship and the positive impact it could have. The most upvoted comment mentioned that while the example provides valuable insight, the success of an acquisition ultimately depends on the entrepreneur's skills and strategy.",
