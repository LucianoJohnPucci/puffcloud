    "Title": "There is a Reddit post discussing a successful business that started in 2007 after the author's previous company failed. They were able to leverage their 22 years of experience and client loyalty while also keeping costs low by working from home. Even during the 2008 crash and the current COVID-19 pandemic, they were able to survive. However, the rising costs in 2020 proved to be unsustainable and they are now considering a part-time contract with a long-term vendor. One commenter praised the author's resilience and adaptability, while others expressed concern over the challenging economic climate for small businesses. The overall sentiment seemed to be one of empathy and support for the author's difficult decision. The top upvoted comment acknowledged the author's resilience and wished them the best for their future endeavors.",
