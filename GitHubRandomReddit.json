Instead, they suggest focusing on high-leverage tasks to create a more efficient workload. Commenters agreed that small businesses require hard work and cannot be fully passive, but also stressed the importance of finding a balance and implementing effective systems. Some also expressed concerns about burnout and the difficulty of delegating properly. Overall, the sentiment was mixed, with some agreeing that small businesses require constant attention, while others shared their success stories with effective delegation. The most upvoted comment stated, \"Delegation is key. It's important to be involved and make key decisions, but being involved in every small task can lead to burnout.\"",
