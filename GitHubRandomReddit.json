    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, a customer shared their frustration with a small business that had a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" policy. The customer had ordered a $50 item but found it unsuitable and returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, due to multiple delivery attempts by USPS, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. When the customer requested a refund, the business refused to cover the $14 return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The commenters had mixed opinions, with some praising the business for their clear return policy and others criticizing their lack of flexibility and fairness towards the customer. The main concerns raised were the inconvenience and extra cost faced by the customer, as well as the perceived injustice of the business not honoring their own policy. The overall sentiment of the commenters leaned towards frustration and disappointment, with many sympathizing with the customer and suggesting a chargeback as a course of action. The comment with the most upvotes expressed the sentiment that \"a business that wants to maintain a good reputation needs to lose a few bucks here and there to keep a customer happy.\"",
