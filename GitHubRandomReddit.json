The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, a Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business is discussed. The campaign spent $100 over 21 days and yielded a conversion rate of 57% with a cost per call of $14.28, indicating strong buyer intent from the callers. While the results were deemed satisfactory with a decent ROAS, the average of one call every three days is seen as a concern. The community suggests refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness. Overall, the sentiment is positive with many commenters praising the campaign's success but also offering suggestions for improvement. The comment with the most upvotes suggests experimenting with different ad formats and placements to further optimize the campaign.",
