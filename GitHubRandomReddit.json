    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds, causing cash flow problems despite having a successful business with no previous issues. Many commenters praise the benefits of the RDR feature, such as quicker dispute resolution and increased security, but express concern over the lack of clear communication from Stripe support and the impact on their cash flow. The overall sentiment is that while the RDR feature is helpful in theory, the lack of transparency and support from Stripe is concerning. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the frustration of many, stating \"it's unacceptable that a successful business with no previous issues is now facing financial struggles due to a poorly implemented feature and lack of communication from Stripe.\"",
