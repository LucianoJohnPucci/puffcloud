    "Title": "The writer's Reddit post expresses concern about an apparent increase in negative experiences with the payment processor Stripe, specifically regarding frozen funds, enhanced due diligence requests, and feeling \"held hostage\". This is especially worrisome for small businesses, as they believe payment processors have a lot of power over them. Despite some positive experiences with Stripe, such as good customer service and ease of use, the main concerns raised include issues with RDR feature, lack of transparency, and the potential for losing essential funds. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and caution, with many suggesting looking into alternative payment processors or taking precautionary actions. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"The way payment processors can basically hold your money hostage without any explanation is truly scary and highlights the need for change in this industry.\"",
