    "Link": "A small business owner, facing declining sales, conducted a survey revealing that nearly 90% of potential customers abandoned their carts due to high shipping costs. Despite offering competitive USPS and FedEx options, the owner struggles with rising rates, particularly from FedEx for larger packages and a lack of discount negotiation from UPS. Attempts to lower shipping prices resulted in product price increases, adversely affecting profitability. The owner has received persistent, unhelpful sales pitches from Unishippers and seeks advice on securing better shipping rates with FedEx or UPS.",

    "Title": "The main concern in this Reddit post is that a small business owner is facing declining sales due to high shipping costs, with almost 90% of potential customers abandoning their carts for this reason. Despite offering competitive USPS and FedEx options, the owner struggles with rising rates, particularly from FedEx for larger packages. Negotiation for discounts with UPS has also been unsuccessful, forcing the owner to raise product prices - resulting in decreased profitability. The owner has received sales pitches from Unishippers that have not been helpful, and is seeking advice on securing better shipping rates from FedEx or UPS. Some commenters suggest that FedEx may have more competitive rates for larger packages, while others warn that switching carriers may not solve the problem and could result in longer transit times. The overall sentiment is that shipping costs are a major concern for small businesses and that the owner should continue to negotiate with UPS and consider other carriers in order to find the best solution. The comment with the most upvotes mentions the importance of building a strong relationship with a shipping provider in order to secure better rates.",
