    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the increase in \"horror stories\" surrounding the use of Stripe as a payment processor for small businesses. Users have noticed a rise in incidents where their funds are frozen, enhanced due diligence is requested, and businesses feel \"held hostage\" by Stripe. Many attribute this to the use of Stripe's \"RDR\" feature and express concerns about the amount of power that payment processors have over small businesses. While some commenters have had positive experiences with Stripe, others have shared their own negative experiences and warn against using the RDR feature. The overall sentiment is one of worry and frustration towards the amount of control payment processors have over small businesses. The most upvoted comment states, \"I've always been a supporter of Stripe, but these horror stories have me reconsidering if I want to continue using them for my business.\"",
