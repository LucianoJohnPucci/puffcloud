    "Title": "The discussion on Reddit revolves around a customer's frustrating experience with a small business that promised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" The customer ordered a $50 item but after realizing it wasn't suitable, returned it paying $14 for shipping. However, due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed,\" it was returned to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing the refund, causing the customer to face an additional $14 cost. The main concern raised by commenters is the business's lack of fairness in honoring their return policy. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the customer has been treated unfairly and should consider a chargeback. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"This is ridiculous, the customer should not have to pay for the return shipping after already paying for the initial shipping. The business needs to honor their return policy.\"",
