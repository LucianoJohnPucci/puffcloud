    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "A Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a 57% conversion rate. Although the campaign yielded a decent return on ad spend and demonstrated buyer intent, the frequency of calls was only one every three days. To improve effectiveness, commenters suggested refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. Other key positive points included meeting immediate needs and booking jobs. The main concerns raised were the high cost per call and the low frequency of calls. Overall, commenters were satisfied with the results, but felt that improvements could be made to increase the number of calls. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the need for better targeting and more specific ad groups for the client's departments.",
