The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The post on Reddit discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls over 21 days at a cost of $14.28 per call. Most callers had immediate needs, reflecting a high level of buyer intent, and 57% of calls resulted in bookings. While the return on ad spend was satisfactory, averaging one call every three days prompted suggestions for improvement, such as refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. Commenters acknowledged the positive aspects of the campaign, such as the high conversion rate and buyer intent, but also raised concerns about the frequency of calls and suggested ways to optimize the campaign. Overall, the sentiment was positive with a focus on improving the campaign for even better results. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the need for targeted ad groups, stating, \"I think breaking it down into four specific ad groups will be more cost-effective in the long run and will help to further optimize your campaign.\"",
