    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author reflects on their experience of running an online business for a year and the surreal feeling of earning more money overnight through automation than in two weeks at their previous job. Many commenters agreed that this is a positive aspect of having an online business, as it allows for financial stability and freedom. Some also shared their own success stories and encouraged the author to embrace their achievements.

This sparked a discussion on the growing wealth gap and the need for a more balanced distribution of wealth. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters can be summarized as a mix of admiration for the author's success and concern for the unequal nature of the system. The comment with the most upvotes expressed this sentiment, stating that it's important to acknowledge privilege and use success to create positive change.",
