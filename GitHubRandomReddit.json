    "Title": "In a Reddit post about an activated Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature triggering \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds, the business owner expressed frustration with the lack of clear communication from support despite having a successful and established business with no issues. The discussion highlights the positive feature of RDR in providing quick and efficient dispute resolution, but also raises concerns about the excessive hold and lack of transparency in the enhanced due diligence process. There is a sense of disappointment and concern among the commenters, with one stating, \"This is a clear abuse of authority on their part.\" The most upvoted comment mentions the need for Stripe to improve their communication and transparency to avoid causing cash flow problems for their clients. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of clear communication and trust between businesses and their payment processors.",
