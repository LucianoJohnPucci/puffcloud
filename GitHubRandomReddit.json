The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

The campaign showed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. While the results were deemed satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), some commenters expressed concerns about the relatively low number of calls received (averaging one call every three days). Suggestions for improvement included refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's different departments. The overall sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many acknowledging the potential for future growth and success with the campaign. The comment with the most upvotes praised the campaign's ability to identify and attract customers with strong intent to purchase.",
