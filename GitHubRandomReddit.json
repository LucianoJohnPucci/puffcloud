    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship as outlined in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build\" book. The example given is a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in SDE, purchased with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. The potential for a 10% annual growth and a sale of $3-4M in ten years is questioned, with commenters sharing various insights and concerns. Positive points include the opportunity for growth and the possibility of a profitable sale, as well as the potential of certain industries to achieve such growth. Concerns include the difficulty of maintaining consistent growth over a decade and the risky nature of small business ventures. The overall sentiment of commenters seems to be cautious optimism, with skepticism towards the feasibility of long-term growth and a reminder to carefully consider all factors before making such a decision.
