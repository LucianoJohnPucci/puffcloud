The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign had a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs being booked. The main highlight of the campaign was the discovery that most callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. While the return on ad spend (ROAS) was satisfactory, averaging one call every three days was seen as a concern. To improve the campaign's effectiveness, future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's different departments. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was positive, with most acknowledging the decent results and providing suggestions for improvement. The comment with the most upvotes emphasized the need for targeted ad groups, stating, \"Creating specific ad groups for each department is a great idea as it will help to tailor the ads to the specific needs of the different buyers.\"",
