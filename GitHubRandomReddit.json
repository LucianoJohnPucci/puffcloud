    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the challenges and successes of a self-employed business owner who started their venture in 2007 after working at a failing company for 18 years. The author and their husband run the business from home, saving on real estate costs, and managed to survive the 2008 financial crash. However, despite their resilience, the business became unsustainable due to rising costs, which increased by 50% in 2020. The author is now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor to keep the business afloat. The commenters were largely positive, acknowledging the author's determination and good fortune in not having to close like many other small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some raised concerns about the stability of relying on a single vendor and suggested diversifying income streams. The overall sentiment was one of empathy and support for the author's difficult decision. The most upvoted comment noted the author's perseverance and resilience in the face of tough challenges.",
