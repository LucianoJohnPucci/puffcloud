    "Title": "The author, a successful side hustler in their 40s, has resigned from their full-time job due to declining mental and physical health. Despite the company's offer to adjust their schedule, the author is doubtful of maintaining the same workload with reduced hours. They are now considering asking for a raise, even though it may put them at risk for future layoffs, as they see their current job as the end of their corporate career and value the remote work flexibility it provides. Many commenters admire the author's success with their side hustle and express concern for their well-being. They offer advice, such as seeking outside help, and express the importance of self-care. Some suggest pursuing the side hustle full-time, while others urge the author to prioritize their physical and mental health above their job. The overall consensus is that the author should prioritize their well-being and consider alternative options for income, rather than risking their health for a raise. The most upvoted comment reads, \"Take care of yourself first, you are the number one priority.\"",
