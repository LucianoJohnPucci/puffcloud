Many commenters believe that both factors play a crucial role in achieving success. On the positive side, some pointed out the importance of having a strong work ethic and well-developed business plans. Others emphasized the power of networking and building relationships with influential individuals.

Many shared a sense of frustration and hopelessness towards the seemingly unattainable nature of success in entrepreneurship. The top voted comment states, \"Success in entrepreneurship is a combination of hard work, strategy, timing, and connections.
