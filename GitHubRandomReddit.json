    "Title": "The Reddit post in question features a small business owner questioning the legitimacy of aluminum price increase claims from their suppliers, which are apparently citing tariffs and industry pricing restrictions as the reason for an 80% price hike. The owner is seeking expert advice to determine the truth behind these claims and whether or not the suppliers are colluding to pad their profits. The overall sentiment from commenters is one of skepticism and concern, with many voicing their own experiences of suppliers taking advantage of current events to raise prices. However, some commenters do acknowledge that tariffs and industry regulations can play a role in price increases. The key concern raised is the lack of transparency and accountability from suppliers, as well as the potential for collusion. The top comment with the most upvotes comes from a user who suggests the business owner communicate directly with their suppliers and demand proof of the price hikes before taking any action.",
