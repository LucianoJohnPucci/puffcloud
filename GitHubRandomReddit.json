    "Link": "A social media manager was hired by a struggling family-owned organic grocer after their income declined post-pandemic. Despite their efforts, none of their drafted social media posts were approved, as the owners view social media as a casual platform rather than a marketing tool. Additionally, the manager's outside sales efforts have not led to significant results, leading to frustration over the owners' expectations.
