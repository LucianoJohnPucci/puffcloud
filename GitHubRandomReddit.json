    "Title": "The post on Reddit discusses the misconception of \"passive\" small business ownership and how it is misleading for small business owners who work over 70 hours a week. Many commenters agree that hard work is necessary for success but argue that with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, small businesses can become less time-consuming. They define \"passive\" as effective management through automation and delegation rather than complete inactivity. Some positive points highlighted by the commenters include the importance of finding a balance between hard work and smart work, utilizing technology and delegation to save time, and the potential for growth and success in small businesses. On the other hand, concerns are raised about the reality of achieving true passive ownership, with some pointing out the challenges and risks associated with delegation and automation. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while it is possible to achieve a level of \"passive\" ownership, it requires determination, effective management, and the right strategies. The most upvoted comment states, \"I totally agree that passive ownership doesn't mean doing nothing but rather using your time wisely to grow your business and make it more efficient.\"",
