    "Title": "The post focuses on a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The customer had ordered a $50 item with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it and paid $14 for shipping. However, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender. The business not only refused to cover the return shipping cost but also insisted on receiving the item before processing a refund, resulting in an additional $14 expense for the customer. This situation has left the customer feeling frustrated and considering a chargeback, believing that the business is not honoring its return policy fairly. Some commenters expressed sympathy for the customer and criticized the business for not standing by their guarantee, while others suggested trying to negotiate with the business or seeking assistance from a third party. The overall sentiment is that the business's handling of the situation is unfair and likely to damage their reputation. The most upvoted comment reads, \"This is not how you build customer loyalty and trust. The business should have covered the return shipping cost and processed the refund promptly.\"",
