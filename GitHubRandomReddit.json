    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post sparked a discussion about a customer's experience with a small business's return policy. The general sentiment of the commenters was that the business did not handle the situation appropriately, leading to frustration and potential loss of trust from the customer. Positive points mentioned include the clear return policy and the customer's effort to return the item. However, main concerns raised were the business's refusal to pay for return shipping and their insistence on physically receiving the item before issuing a refund. Many commenters felt this was unreasonable and suggested the business improve their customer service. The most upvoted comment stated, \"If the business claims to have a 100% satisfaction guarantee, they should honor it without causing additional inconvenience or costs to the customer.\" This sentiment was echoed by several other commenters, emphasizing the importance of transparency and fairness in business practices.",
