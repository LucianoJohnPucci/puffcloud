    "Title": "The Reddit post is from the owner of a handmade jewelry business who is looking for advice on how to negotiate a profit margin with the owner of a chain of small boutiques. The boutique owner is interested in carrying their products and has requested a minimum of 50 units of each design to stock all of their stores. Many commenters highlighted the potential positive impact of this opportunity, such as increased exposure and sales for the jeweler. Some suggested negotiating a higher profit margin due to the unique and handmade nature of the jewelry. However, there were also concerns raised about the potential cost and time of producing such large quantities, as well as the risk of losing the brand's uniqueness and quality. The overall sentiment among the commenters was cautious optimism, as they recognized both the benefits and challenges of this opportunity. The comment with the most upvotes advised the jeweler to calculate their production costs and factor in a profit margin that is fair for both parties.",
