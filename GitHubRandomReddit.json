    "Title": "The Reddit discussion centered around a small business owner who was sued for website inaccessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), even though they were using an official Shopify theme and approved accessible apps. Many commenters expressed frustration and concern over the fact that the lawsuit was filed without any prior complaint or opportunity to address the issue. This has already cost the owner thousands of dollars and they are seeking help, support, and potential collective action to combat these types of lawsuits. Several positive points were raised, including the need for web providers like Shopify to take responsibility for their products and ensure accessibility for all individuals. However, the main concern was the potential for more of these lawsuits to be filed in the future, causing undue financial strain on small businesses. The overall sentiment of the commenters was one of sympathy towards the small business owner and a desire to see a solution to this issue. The comment with the most upvotes succinctly stated, \"This kind of predatory behavior needs to stop. ADA compliance is important, but there needs to be a fair and reasonable process for addressing violations.\"",
