    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a situation where a customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it. However, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. The main points raised by commenters were that the business should have paid for the return shipping as it was their responsibility, and that the customer should not have to pay for USPS's mistake. Concerns were also raised about the business not honoring its return policy and causing extra stress and cost for the customer. The overall sentiment of the commenters was frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment stated, \"If the package was marked as unclaimed through no fault of the customer, the business should be responsible for all costs associated with it. That's just good business practice.\"",
