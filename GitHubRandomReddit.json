    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner shares their experience of finding a supplier on Instagram and requesting exclusivity in their region. While the owner initially believed they had secured a unique partnership, they soon discovered that the supplier was also reaching out to their competitors. Commenters offered positive advice, suggesting that the best approach may be to negotiate a contract or offer incentives for exclusivity. However, some raised concerns about the feasibility of completely restricting the supplier's business dealings and the ethical implications of doing so.

The comment with the most upvotes suggested that the owner should focus on building a strong brand and loyal customer base instead of relying solely on exclusivity.",
