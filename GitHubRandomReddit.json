    "Title": "The Reddit post in question is written by a small business owner who challenges the common misconception that owning a small business is a passive endeavor. The author argues that with the right systems, automation, and delegation, a small business can actually involve focusing on high-leverage tasks rather than constantly working long hours. They also mention that true \"passive\" ownership of a business requires strategic effort, rather than complete neglect. While there were some commenters who shared similar experiences and agreed with the author's points, some raised concerns about the feasibility of implementing these systems and delegating effectively. The overall sentiment seemed to be that owning a small business is a challenging but rewarding endeavor that requires effort and dedication. The most upvoted comment was in agreement with the author's perspective, stating, \"As a small business owner myself, I couldn't agree more. It's all about being smart with your time and resources.\"",
