The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days, resulting in 1,800 impressions and 7 calls with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of the callers had immediate needs, showing strong buyer intent. While the results were deemed satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend, some commenters expressed concerns about the low frequency of calls (one call every three days). Suggestions were made to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness. The overall sentiment of the commenters was positive, acknowledging the success of the campaign but also highlighting areas for improvement. The comment with the most upvotes pointed out the potential for the client's business to benefit from targeted ad groups for each department.",
