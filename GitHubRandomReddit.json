    "Title": "This Reddit post addresses a situation where a small business is struggling to stay afloat financially and is faced with requests from an underperforming employee for paid time off and paid holidays. Many commenters express empathy for the couple's financial struggles and suggest negotiating with the employee for unpaid time off or a reduced work schedule instead of outright denying their requests. A few optimistic comments suggest looking into government resources or other financial solutions to support the business. However, there is also concern expressed over the potential consequences of not giving PTO to hourly workers, such as low morale and high turnover rates. Most commenters agree that it is common for hourly workers to not receive PTO, but also discuss the importance of providing some form of time off for employee well-being. The top-rated comment, with 451 upvotes, suggests finding a compromise that works for both the business and the employee, such as offering unpaid leave for the requested time off. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is understanding and supportive, recognizing the challenges of running a small business but urging the couple to prioritize their employees' well-being.",
