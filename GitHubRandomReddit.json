    "Title": "There has been a recent surge in concerns about Stripe payment processor, especially among small businesses. Many commenters have shared their positive experiences with Stripe, citing its user-friendly interface and efficient payment processing. However, the discussion quickly turns to the negative experiences of some small businesses, who have had their funds frozen and have been asked for enhanced due diligence, leading to delays and financial stress. Some commenters note that these occurrences seem to happen more frequently when enabling Stripe's RDR feature, which allows businesses to store customer credit card information for recurring payments. This raises concerns about the power payment processors have over small businesses, with one commenter calling it \"corporate bullying.\" The overall sentiment among the commenters is one of frustration and fear, as many small business owners rely on payment processors like Stripe to conduct their day-to-day operations. The most upvoted comment summarizes the general sentiment by stating, \"It's clear that there is a lack of transparency and clear communication from Stripe, leaving small businesses vulnerable to their decisions.\"",
