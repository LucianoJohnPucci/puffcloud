    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner shares their struggle after losing ?4,000, their entire savings, due to a failed advertising campaign with an agency. Despite having 390 orders over 3 years, the business is facing financial difficulties and the owner is at a loss for what to do, with health issues preventing them from getting a regular job to raise funds. On the positive side, many commenters offer sympathy and support to the owner, offering advice and suggestions for alternative solutions. They point out the owner's determination and hard work, which have kept the business afloat despite the financial setbacks. However, a major concern raised by commenters is the lack of experience and expertise in running a business, particularly in the area of marketing. They suggest seeking professional help or learning more about advertising and promoting the business. Overall, the sentiment of commenters is one of understanding and empathy, but also a sense of frustration and concern for the owner's situation. The comment with the most upvotes is one that offers practical advice on creating a business plan and seeking crowdfunding to help recover from the financial loss.",
