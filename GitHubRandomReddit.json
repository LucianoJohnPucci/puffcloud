    "Title": "The Reddit thread addresses a small business owner who has been sued for ADA website inaccessibility despite using an official Shopify theme and approved accessible apps. The business owner feels scammed and is seeking support and potential collective action to hold web providers like Shopify accountable. Many commenters expressed empathy for the business owner and highlighted the high cost of ADA lawsuits, with one commenter saying it has become a \"money-making scheme\" for some law firms. There were positive mentions of the business owner's efforts to be accessible and using Shopify's official theme and approved apps, but concerns were raised about the lack of specific guidelines and enforcement for website accessibility. The overall sentiment of commenters was frustration with the potential financial burden of ADA lawsuits for small businesses and a call for more support and guidance from both the government and e-commerce platforms like Shopify. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"ADA compliance is important, but there needs to be a better system in place to protect small businesses from predatory lawsuits.\"",
