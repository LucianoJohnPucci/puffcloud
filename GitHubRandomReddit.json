    "Title": "The Reddit post revolves around a frustrated customer who ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After returning the item and paying $14 for shipping, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but they refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item first, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. The main positive point raised by commenters is the importance of a clear and fair return policy for small businesses. Many commenters also empathized with the customer, feeling that the business was not honoring their return policy fairly. The main concern raised was the lack of communication and customer service from the business, as well as their refusal to take responsibility for the return shipping. The overall sentiment of the commenters is frustration and disappointment towards the business. The top upvoted comment reflects this sentiment, stating \"A return policy is only as good as the business' willingness to honor it.\"",
