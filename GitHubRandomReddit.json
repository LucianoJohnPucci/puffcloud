    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shared their frustrating experience with a small business after returning a $50 item. The business had advertised a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but when the customer returned the item and paid $14 for shipping, it was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender by USPS. The business then refused to cover the return shipping costs and insisted on receiving the item in order to process the refund, leaving the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Many commenters expressed frustration and disappointment with the business, feeling that their return policy was not being honored fairly. Some positive points highlighted by commenters include the importance of reading return policies carefully and the benefits of shopping from small businesses. However, the main concerns raised were the lack of communication from the business and their unwillingness to cover the return shipping costs. The overall sentiment of the commenters was negative, with many suggesting a chargeback and expressing a loss of trust in the business. The comment with the most upvotes was from a user who recommended contacting the business directly to try and resolve the situation before considering a chargeback.",
