    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author is exploring the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship presented in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario involves an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and using a 90% SBA loan for financing. The goal is to increase the business's revenue by 10% annually and eventually sell it for $3-4M in ten years. Many commenters are skeptical about the feasibility of achieving a consistent 10% growth rate over a decade, with some suggesting it is highly dependent on the industry and market conditions. While some point out the potential risks and challenges of pursuing this strategy, others highlight the benefits of using an SBA loan and the potential for high returns. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with many expressing caution and emphasizing the need for thorough research and a solid business plan before embarking on this path. The most upvoted comment mentions that while the strategy may work in some niches, it may not be applicable for all types of businesses due to their inherent differences.",
