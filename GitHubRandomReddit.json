    "Title": "The Reddit post is about a small business owner who started their company in 2007 after working at a failing company for 18 years. They have been able to leverage their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to work from home and avoid real estate costs, even surviving the 2008 economic crash. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the business has become unsustainable due to rising costs, leading the author and their husband to consider a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. The post received a range of comments, with many highlighting the resilience and determination of the author to keep their business afloat for over a decade. Others commended the author for adapting to difficult economic circumstances and being open to new opportunities. However, some expressed concerns about the potential risks and uncertainties of switching to a 1099 contract. The overall sentiment of the commenters towards the business was supportive and empathetic, with many recognizing the struggles faced by small business owners during the pandemic. The most upvoted comment was \"Hats off to you for trying your best to keep your business going during these difficult times.\"",
