    "Title": "The Reddit post highlights the growing concern regarding the negative experiences small businesses are facing with Stripe payment processor. Many commenters expressed their frustration with the sudden freezing of funds, demands for enhanced due diligence, and feeling \"held hostage\" by the company.

The consensus among commenters is that payment processors hold too much power over small businesses, leaving them vulnerable to financial setbacks. The most upvoted comment echoes this sentiment, stating, \"It's scary to think how much control these processors have over our businesses.\" Some positive points were also raised, such as the convenience and ease of use of Stripe, but it seems overshadowed by the overall concern and fear of being at the mercy of payment processors.",
