    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author, a small business owner, challenges the notion that running a small business can be \"passive.\" They acknowledge that with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, it's possible to reduce workload by focusing on high-leverage tasks, automation, and delegation. However, they also emphasize that running a successful business still requires significant effort and cannot be entirely hands-off. Commenters largely agree with the author, highlighting the benefits of automation and delegation, but also express concerns about the risks and challenges of trying to \"scale\" too quickly. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of support and understanding of the author's perspective, with many sharing their own experiences and offering advice. The comment with the most upvotes comes from a business owner who agrees that it is possible to reduce workload through strategic systems and delegation, but cautions that it takes time, effort, and resources to achieve this level of efficiency.",
