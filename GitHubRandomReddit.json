    "Title": "This Reddit post features a small business owner questioning the legitimacy of aluminum price increases from their suppliers, who claim 80% hikes due to tariffs and industry pricing restrictions. The discussion raised several key points, including the impact of tariffs on material costs and the possibility of suppliers colluding to pad profits. A majority of commenters express skepticism towards the suppliers' claims, citing alternative reasons for the price hikes such as supply and demand fluctuations. Some also raise concerns about the lack of transparency in pricing and suggest seeking out alternative suppliers. However, there were also commenters who believed tariff-related price hikes were justified and recommended considering long-term contracts to mitigate future price fluctuations. The most upvoted comment suggests reaching out to government agencies for information on tariffs and their impact on prices. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters leans towards suspicion and calls for further research and alternative solutions to mitigate the price increases.",
