    "Title": "The discussion on the Reddit post highlights the struggles faced by small businesses currently, with the author seeking to identify industries that are experiencing growth and profitability. The majority of commenters agree that construction and tradespeople seem to be doing better, with a few others also mentioning technology and healthcare as potentially profitable industries. Positive points raised include the increase in demand for construction and trades services due to people spending more time at home, and the potential for new government policies to boost these industries. However, concerns were also raised about the long-term sustainability of this growth and the potential negative impacts of a \"boom and bust\" cycle. The overall sentiment is a mix of cautious optimism and skepticism, with commenters acknowledging the positive signs but also expressing caution and a need for further analysis. The comment with the most upvotes was one stating that the healthcare industry, specifically telehealth, has been consistently growing and offers more stability for small businesses.",
