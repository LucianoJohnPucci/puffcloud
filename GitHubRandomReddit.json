The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. This yielded a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. While the return on ad spend (ROAS) was satisfactory, with an average of one call every three days, commenters identified areas for improvement. Suggestions included refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to enhance campaign effectiveness. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many acknowledging the decent ROAS and recognizing the potential for further optimization. However, concerns were raised about the low number of calls and the need for more targeted ads. The most upvoted comment noted the importance of maximizing the campaign's potential by analyzing and optimizing their targeting strategy.",
