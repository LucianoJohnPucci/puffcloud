    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the dilemma of a handmade jewelry business owner who is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a boutique chain owner who is interested in carrying their products. The boutique owner is requesting a minimum of 50 units of each design to stock all of their stores, but the jeweler is unsure of what a reasonable profit margin is as they have not produced high quantities before. The primary positive points raised are the potential for increased exposure and sales, as well as the opportunity to build a long-term partnership. The main concerns raised include finding a balance between profitability and maintaining the integrity and uniqueness of the jewelry, as well as the challenge of producing such a large quantity. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that this is a great opportunity for the jeweler, but they should carefully consider the terms and negotiate for a fair profit margin. The comment with the most upvotes suggests setting a minimum order quantity and incremental profit margin based on the quantity ordered to ensure a mutually beneficial partnership.",
