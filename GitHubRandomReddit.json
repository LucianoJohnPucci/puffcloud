    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the notion of small businesses being truly passive and challenges it through the perspective of a small business owner who works over 70 hours a week. Some commenters agree that it is not possible to be completely disengaged from a small business, even with effective systems and delegation, and instead advocate for focusing on high-leverage tasks to create a more efficient workload. This is seen as a positive approach to balancing a busy work schedule and achieving success for the business. Concerns were raised about the pressure to always be working and the idea that \"hustle culture\" glorifies overworking. The overall sentiment of the commenters leans towards finding a balance between being actively involved in the business and prioritizing tasks that will have the most impact. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of being strategic in one's work and finding ways to reduce workload without compromising the success of the business.",
