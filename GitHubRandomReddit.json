Previously, as a sole proprietor, these expenses were classified as ?Contract Labor? on Schedule C. Their CPA suggests categorizing them as ?Other Deductibles? with a statement explaining the expenses, while the bookkeeper advises categorizing them under ?Cost of Goods Sold? (CoGS) to better reflect business operations and avoid potential audit risks associated with excessive ?Miscellaneous Expenses.? The author is inclined to favor the bookkeeper's approach but seeks additional perspectives on the matter.",

    "Title": "Many commenters on this Reddit post offer their insights into the dilemma faced by the author, a one-person marketing agency transitioning to an S-Corp, on how to categorize subcontractor expenses on their 1120S tax form. The author's CPA suggests putting the expenses under \"Other Deductibles\" with an explanation, while the bookkeeper recommends classifying them under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (CoGS) to better align with business operations and avoid potential audit risks. While some commenters agree with the bookkeeper's approach, others suggest that following the CPA's suggestion may be a safer option. The main concern raised is the potential for an audit due to excessive \"Miscellaneous Expenses.\" Most commenters lean towards the bookkeeper's approach, believing that it accurately reflects business operations and reduces the chance of audit. The top voted comment states, \"I agree with the bookkeeper's advice. It's important to accurately reflect your business operations and avoid potential audit risks.\"",
