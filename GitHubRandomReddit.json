    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the damaging misconception that a good product will automatically sell itself for entrepreneurs. The majority of commenters agreed that while having a great product is important, effective marketing strategies and strong online engagement are essential for success. Many shared their own experiences of struggling with this idea and emphasized the need for a strategic approach to promote their products. Some raised concerns about the oversaturation of the market and the difficulty in standing out without a well-planned marketing strategy. Overall, the sentiment among commenters was that relying solely on the quality of a product is not enough in today's competitive market, and proactive marketing efforts are crucial for success. The most upvoted comment by user u/jayrora sums it up well, stating \"The old saying \"build it and they will come\" no longer applies in the digital age. You need to actively reach out and engage with potential customers to make your product stand out.\"",
