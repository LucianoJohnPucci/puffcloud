    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a business owner with nine years of experience is seeking advice on how to sell their struggling company. Despite price reductions and hiring a new broker, the business has been on the market for nine months with no success. The owner is considering whether to continue working with the broker or try selling independently, and also exploring creative selling strategies and the feasibility of an employee buyout. They also ask about options for closing the business and potential buyer targets, while still wanting to be fairly compensated for their investment. The discussion largely focused on whether the owner should switch brokers or try selling independently, with some commenters suggesting creative ways to market the business and considering ways to close if a sale is not feasible. The overall sentiment was sympathetic and supportive, with many commenters offering advice and sharing their own experiences with selling a business. The top upvoted comment advises the owner to consider hiring a new broker if the current one has not been successful, but also to invest time and effort into exploring other selling strategies such as networking and social media.",
