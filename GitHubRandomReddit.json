    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $200k SDE, invests $100k, and obtains a 90% SBA loan to grow the business and sell it for a profit in 10 years. The main positive points mentioned by commenters include the potential for a high return on investment and the possibility of using this strategy to enter a new market or industry. However, there are also concerns raised about the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade, and the risk involved in taking on a large SBA loan. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is cautious optimism, with many discussing the need for a solid business plan and careful due diligence before pursuing this strategy. The most upvoted comment comes from a user who advises considering industries with stable demand and low competition for sustained growth.",
