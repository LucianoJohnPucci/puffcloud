Many emphasize that passive income from a small business is possible, but it requires hard work and smart strategies. The top-voted comment highlights the importance of creating systems and delegating tasks to free up time for high-leverage activities.\n\nTop comment:\n\"It's true that passive income from a small business is possible, but it takes effort and smart strategies. I've been able to achieve it by creating systems and delegating tasks, but it's not easy and requires constant management and adjustment. Focus on high-leverage tasks and the potential is there, but it's definitely not a hands-off experience.\"",
