    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel, which presents the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship using a hypothetical scenario of buying a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200k in SDE with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan. Overall, commenters have a positive view of the potential of this acquisition strategy, noting that it offers more stability and lower risk compared to starting a business from scratch. Key positive points include the potential for steady growth and the possibility of leveraging SBA loans for financing. However, some commenters raise concerns about the consistently achievable 10% annual revenue growth over a 10-year period, with some questioning the feasibility of such a high growth rate. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, as commenters offer valuable insights on various small business niches that could have the potential to meet this growth trajectory. The top comment with the most upvotes suggests focusing on industries with high demand and low competition.",
