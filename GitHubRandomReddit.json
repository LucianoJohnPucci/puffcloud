    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's experience with a small business's return policy. The main positive points raised by commenters include the fact that the customer followed the return policy, the business has a satisfaction guarantee, and the customer only paid $14 for shipping. However, the main concern raised is that the business did not honor its return policy when the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and the customer is being charged an additional $14 for return shipping. Commenters express frustration with the business and some suggest a chargeback as a solution. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business is being unfair in not covering the return shipping cost as stated in their policy. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"The business should honor their return policy and cover the return shipping cost. It's not fair to the customer who followed all the guidelines.\"",
