    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the idea of small businesses being \"passive\" and the challenges faced by business owners who work over 70 hours a week. The overall sentiment shared by commenters is that while automation, delegation, and high-leverage tasks can help reduce the workload for small business owners, they still require significant effort and cannot be entirely hands-off. Many commenters agree that with the right opportunities and experience, it is possible to create systems that can help take some of the burden off of small business owners. However, there are also concerns raised about the potential costs and risks of relying too heavily on automation, and the importance of maintaining a personal touch in running a successful business. The most upvoted comment emphasizes the need for balance, stating, \"Automation is great but it should never be a substitute for authentic customer service.\" Overall, the discussion acknowledges the benefits and challenges of running a small business and highlights the importance of finding a balance between efficiency and personal attention.",
