    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the owner of a handmade jewelry business is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a chain of small boutiques interested in carrying their products. The owner is unsure of what a reasonable profit margin is as a handcrafter and designer, having never produced high quantities before. The boutique owner is requesting a minimum of 50 units of each design to stock all of their stores. The key positive points raised by commenters include emphasizing the value and uniqueness of handmade items and the potential for increased exposure and sales through the boutiques. Main concerns revolve around the potential for lower profit margins and maintaining the quality and authenticity of the products. The overall sentiment of commenters is cautiously optimistic, with many suggesting starting with a smaller order and negotiating a fair margin that takes into account the time and effort put into each handmade piece. The top upvoted comment suggests setting a fair price with a 40-50% profit margin and being transparent about production costs.",
