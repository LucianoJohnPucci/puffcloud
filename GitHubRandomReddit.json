    "Title": "In the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel, the author discusses a hypothetical scenario for acquisition entrepreneurs, proposing that investing $100k in a $1M business could lead to a sale for $3-4M in ten years through consistent 10% annual revenue growth. The Reddit discussion begins with many commenters highlighting the potential benefits of this strategy, citing examples of successful businesses they have personally seen or been involved in. However, some express skepticism about the sustainability of such growth, particularly for a business currently generating $1.5M in revenue. Many commenters suggest that a highly specialized or niche business may be better suited for this trajectory, with one commenter mentioning the healthcare industry as an example. The overall sentiment seems to be a mix of caution and optimism, with some questioning the feasibility but others sharing their own success stories. The comment with the most upvotes mentions the importance of having a solid business plan and executing it well in order to achieve this level of growth.",
