    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses an owner of a handmade jewelry business seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a chain of small boutiques interested in carrying their products. Positive points raised include the potential for increased exposure and sales, as well as the opportunity to establish a partnership with a reputable retailer. However, main concerns revolve around maintaining the uniqueness and quality of the handmade pieces in larger quantities, as well as the potential for losing profitability in a lower profit margin. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is cautionary, with many suggesting the jeweler carefully consider the business implications and negotiate for a fair profit margin. The highest upvoted comment advises the jeweler to not settle for a profit margin lower than their current margins and to negotiate for a lower quantity of units to protect the quality of their products.",
