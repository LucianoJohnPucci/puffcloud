    "Title": "This Reddit post delves into the author's reflections on their experience of running an online business for a year. They express a sense of surrealism as their automated systems generate a significant amount of income overnight, much more than what they would earn in two weeks at their previous 9-5 job. The author feels a mix of satisfaction and discomfort knowing that their friends are still working traditional jobs, while they are reaping the benefits of automation with minimal effort. However, there are concerns raised about the fairness of this system, as it highlights the stark disparity between the author's situation and that of their friends who work hard for their income. The overall sentiment of the commenters is a mixture of awe at the potential of automation and a sense of unease at the unequal distribution of wealth. The top comment with the most upvotes reads, \"I can't imagine how surreal it must feel to earn more money overnight from automation than what most people earn in two weeks. It's a reminder of the growing divide between the haves and the have-nots in our society.\"",
