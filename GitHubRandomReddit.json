    "Title": "The post from a small business owner on Reddit sparked a lively discussion on the misconception that owning a small business is \"passive.\" Many commenters agreed that entrepreneurship requires constant effort and hard work, but some also shared positive experiences of implementing systems, automation, and delegation to create a more manageable workload. The main concerns raised were the challenges of finding the right balance between working hard and delegating tasks, as well as the importance of not neglecting the business entirely in pursuit of \"passive\" income. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was that true \"passive\" business ownership requires strategic effort and cannot be achieved through complete neglect. The most upvoted comment by user u/BusinessGuru emphasized the need for continuous effort to achieve success in small business ownership.",
