    "Title": "The Reddit post, titled \"Entrepreneurs, what is the worst advice you've ever received?\", shares an oft-quoted but misguided belief that a good product is enough to guarantee success for entrepreneurs. The majority of commenters shared their personal experiences of this misconception, with many advocating the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement. Key positive points included the recognition that successful business requires more than just a good product, but also strong branding, customer engagement, and communication. Main concerns raised were the potential downfall of not investing in marketing and the danger of relying solely on the product itself to sell. The overall sentiment of commenters was that this advice is dangerous and misleading, and a better understanding of the role of marketing and customer engagement is necessary for entrepreneurship success. The comment with the highest number of upvotes, by user EezAyd, succinctly summarizes this sentiment, stating \"A good product is just the beginning of success; marketing and communication are the keys to making it sell.\"",
