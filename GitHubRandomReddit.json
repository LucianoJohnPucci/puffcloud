    "Title": "The Reddit post describes a small business owner struggling with declining sales and high shipping costs. After implementing an automated email to inquire about abandoned carts, they discovered that 90% of customers cited shipping costs as the main reason. The business ships 30-50 boxes daily via FedEx, with many packages exceeding 1 cubic foot.
