The boutique owner is requesting a minimum of 50 units per design for all their stores, leaving the jeweler unsure of a reasonable profit margin as they have not produced high quantities before. The overall sentiment from commenters is positive, with many emphasizing the opportunity for increased exposure and sales. Key positive points include the potential to build a strong business relationship and the importance of setting a fair and reasonable profit margin. Main concerns raised include the potential for a high volume of inventory and the need for clear communication and transparency between both parties. The most upvoted comment suggests negotiating a tiered pricing structure based on the quantity ordered, with a lower margin for higher quantities, to benefit both parties.",
