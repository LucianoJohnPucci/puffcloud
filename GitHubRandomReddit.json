    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, a small business owner expresses their belief that the idea of \"passive\" small business ownership is misleading. Despite acknowledging the importance of hard work, they argue that with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, small businesses can become less time-consuming. The key positive points discussed by commenters include the potential for automation and delegation to make management more efficient, as well as the need for proper planning and support to achieve a more balanced work-life. However, concerns were raised about the difficulty of finding these opportunities and implementing effective systems, as well as the risk of burnout for small business owners. Overall, the sentiment of the majority of commenters seems to be that while passive ownership may not be entirely attainable, there are certainly steps that can be taken to make small business ownership less time-consuming. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of creating a strong team and delegation as key elements of successful small business management.",
