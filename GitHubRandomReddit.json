    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author is discussing the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship as presented by Walter Deibel in \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario presented involves an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the revenue by 10% annually and sell the business for $3-4M in ten years. Many commenters acknowledge the potential for success in this approach, citing the low risk and high return on investment. However, there are concerns about the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade, as it may be challenging to sustain such rapid growth in some industries. Some suggest that focusing on niche markets or industries with high growth potential could support this goal. Overall, the sentiment is positive towards the idea of acquisition entrepreneurship, but skepticism remains around the specific growth targets outlined in the scenario. The comment with the most upvotes suggests that finding the right niche market is crucial for success in this approach.",
