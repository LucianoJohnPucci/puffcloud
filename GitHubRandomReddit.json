Several strategies were suggested by the commenters to convince the supplier to sell exclusively to the seller, such as offering better terms and building a stronger partnership. The key positive points highlighted by the commenters include the importance of communication and transparency in business relationships and the need for the seller to stand their ground and enforce the exclusivity agreement.
