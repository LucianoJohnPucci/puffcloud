    "Title": "The Reddit post features a discussion on the effectiveness of the website for Everm?e, a digital locket product aimed at the US and Canada markets. The creator is seeking feedback on their homepage, product page, and customization options, as their current conversion rate stands at only 2 sales for every 2,500 visitors. While the business strategy involves educating potential customers and building a retail network, the company has faced challenges with low visibility, high costs, and ineffective advertising. Despite some initial offline sales, the creator is still facing difficulties and invites honest feedback and potential collaboration opportunities. The key positive points mentioned by commenters include the unique concept of a digital locket and the potential for high demand, as well as the intuitive website design and easy customization options. However, concerns were raised about the lack of advertising, difficulty of explaining the product to potential customers, and the need for more traditional marketing strategies like attending trade shows. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is supportive but critical of the company's approach and suggests focusing on increasing visibility and improving marketing strategies. The top-voted comment states, \"I think attending trade shows and getting the product in the hands of influencers could really help generate buzz and sales.\"",
