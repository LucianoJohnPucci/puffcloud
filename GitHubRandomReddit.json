Many commenters praise the author's success and motivation in creating a successful business, while others express concerns about the growing income inequality and the impact of automation on traditional jobs. The overall sentiment is a mix of admiration for the author's hard work and success, while also acknowledging the issue of income disparity and the potential challenges of automation. The most upvoted comment states, \"It's a double-edged sword, but it's impressive that you were able to create such a successful business. But we also need to address the larger issue of automation and its impact on income inequality.\"",
