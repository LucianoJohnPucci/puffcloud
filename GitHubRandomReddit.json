    "Title": "The author of this Reddit post, a small business owner, presents a challenge to the idea that owning a small business can be a passive endeavor. Despite working over 70 hours a week, they acknowledge that with the right opportunities, systems, and automation and delegation skills, a small business can require less time commitment. The author clarifies that \"passive\" should not be misinterpreted as neglecting the business for extended periods, but rather focusing on high-leverage tasks. The main positive points that emerged from the comments include the importance of having efficient systems in place and the significance of being able to delegate effectively to reduce the workload. However, concerns were also raised about the risk of burnout and the difficulty in finding the right balance between delegation and maintaining control over the business. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that owning a small business requires dedication and hard work but can also provide opportunities for more flexibility and freedom. The comment with the most upvotes emphasizes the importance of finding a balance and not relying on automation and delegation as a way to completely disconnect from the business.",
