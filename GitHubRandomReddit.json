    "Title": "In a Reddit post, an entrepreneur shared their experience of joining a fast growth and investor funding-focused group, but ultimately preferring stable growth and self-funding for their business approach. However, they were met with criticism for not working hard enough and prioritizing work-life balance. The author expressed being hurt by the comments, but remains steadfast in their goal of building a business that supports their personal lifestyle. The discussion was largely positive, with many commenters commending the author for valuing work-life balance and defending their decision to prioritize stability over rapid growth and external funding. Some raised concerns about the potential limitations of self-funding and the importance of striking a balance between work and personal life, but the overall sentiment was supportive and understanding of the author's approach. The most upvoted comment stated, \"Work-life balance is crucial for sustainable success. Don't let anyone discourage you from building a business that fits your lifestyle.\"",
