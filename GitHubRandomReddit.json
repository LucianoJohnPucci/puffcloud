    "Title": "The Reddit post sparked a lively discussion among users about the prospect of a handmade jewelry business negotiating with a chain of small boutiques. Many commenters were positive about the opportunity, noting that it could provide valuable exposure for the jeweler and potentially lead to a significant increase in sales. However, there were also concerns raised about the boutique owner's requirement of a minimum of 50 units per design, as this could be a challenging volume for a small, handcrafted business to produce. The overall sentiment seemed to be one of encouragement and support, with several users offering helpful advice and tips for negotiating a fair profit margin. One top comment, by user u/handmadewithlove, received the most upvotes and advised the jeweler to carefully consider the potential costs and benefits of the deal before making any decisions.",
