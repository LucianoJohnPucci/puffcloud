In this model, an individual buys a $1M business (generating $1.5M in revenue and $200k in seller's discretionary earnings) through a combination of personal investment and an SBA loan. The scenario predicts a 10% annual revenue growth over ten years, leading to a potential sale price of $3-4M. The author questions the realism of sustaining such growth consistently and seeks to identify small business niches that could align with this growth profile.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author discusses their reading of Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which presents a simplistic model of acquisition entrepreneurship where an individual buys a $1M business through a personal investment and an SBA loan. The model predicts a 10% annual revenue growth over ten years, leading to a potential sale price of $3-4M. Many commenters express positive sentiments towards the overall concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, noting the potential for high returns and the benefits of buying an established business rather than starting from scratch. However, concerns are raised about the realism of sustaining such consistent growth over ten years, as well as the potential risks and challenges involved in acquiring and managing a business. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with commenters offering advice and sharing their own experiences in small business ownership. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of careful due diligence and research before making an acquisition.",
