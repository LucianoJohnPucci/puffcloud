The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign had a decent return on ad spend (ROAS) with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. However, the campaign only averaged one call every three days, despite revealing that most callers had immediate needs. Commenters pointed out the need for refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness. While there were positive aspects, such as the high conversion rate and clear buyer intent, the low number of calls raised concerns about the overall effectiveness of the campaign. The general sentiment among commenters was that the campaign showed potential but could be further optimized to achieve better results. The most upvoted comment stated, \"The fact that most callers had immediate needs and the conversion rate was high speaks for the effectiveness of the campaign. However, there is definitely room for improvement in terms of targeting and ad groups.\"",
