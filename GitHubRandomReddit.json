One commenter offers to pay $1000 to offset the potential revenue loss from terminating X, plus renewing their annual pass and prepaying for the remainder of X's pass. The overall sentiment is divided, with some commenters in favor of terminating X for the sake of customer experience, while others express concern over making a decision based solely on complaints.
