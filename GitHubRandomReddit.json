    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner has shared their experience of finding a supplier for their clothing and shoe business on Instagram. The owner initially requested exclusivity in their region from the supplier but later discovered that the supplier was also messaging their competitors. The post has generated a lot of discussion, with commenters offering both positive points and concerns. Some of the key positive points include the benefits of having exclusivity, such as increased sales and brand recognition. However, concerns were raised about the practicality of convincing the supplier to sell only to the owner and the potential for the supplier to continue messaging competitors despite any promises made. Overall, commenters seemed to have mixed sentiments about the situation, with some suggesting legal action and others offering more diplomatic solutions. One commenter with the most upvotes advised the owner to communicate their disappointment and concerns to the supplier and potentially negotiate a non-compete agreement.",
