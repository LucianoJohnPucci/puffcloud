    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" which presents the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship. The author highlights the hypothetical example of an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with a 90% SBA loan and projecting a 10% annual revenue growth, leading to a potential sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The discussion garnered both positive and concerning points from commenters. Some pointed out the potential for consistent 10% growth in niche businesses like healthcare, technology, and home services. Others raised concerns about the feasibility of achieving such growth in a competitive market and the high risk involved in relying heavily on loans. Overall, the sentiment among commenters was skeptical yet open to the idea, with one commenter stating, \"I think it's a great strategy but requires a lot of research and due diligence.\" The most upvoted comment noted the importance of having a solid exit plan and continuously analyzing the market to ensure success, stating, \"Consistency is key in growth, and making sure to plan for that exit is vital.\"",
