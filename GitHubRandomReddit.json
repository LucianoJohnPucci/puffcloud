The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over a period of 21 days and yielded 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign had a decent return on ad spend (ROAS) with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs booked. The majority of the callers showed immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. However, the campaign averaged only one call every three days, prompting the discussion of ways to improve its effectiveness, such as refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's departments. While most commenters were positive about the decent results and the potential for improvement, some raised concerns about the high cost per call and low call frequency. The overall sentiment was that the campaign had room for improvement, but was still satisfactory. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the need to focus on specific, targeted ad groups to reach the right audience.",
