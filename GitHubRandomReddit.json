    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post on the r/WorkersStrikeBack thread, users addressed the ongoing debate surrounding worker treatment and rights within small businesses. Many positive points were raised, such as the importance of fair wages and benefits for employees, the need for workplace safety measures, and the recognition that small businesses are not exempt from providing fair treatment. However, concerns were also expressed, including the impact of labor costs on small business owners and the potential risks of automation in the workforce. Overall, commenters seemed to have a strong sentiment towards advocating for better treatment of workers, with a focus on holding small businesses accountable for providing fair working conditions. The top upvoted comment echoed this sentiment, stating, \"Small business owners should be able to make a profit without exploiting their workers. If they can't, then maybe their business model isn't sustainable.\"",
