The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business that spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign had a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs booked. The results showed immediate buyer intent and a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), but the average of one call every three days was seen as less than satisfactory. The future plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's departments were considered positive steps to improve campaign effectiveness. However, some concerns were raised about the limited reach and the need for a longer campaign period to fully gauge success. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was positive, with most applauding the efforts and offering suggestions for improvements. The comment with the most upvotes was from a user who praised the company for considering future targeting strategies and for acknowledging the need to cater to different departments.",
