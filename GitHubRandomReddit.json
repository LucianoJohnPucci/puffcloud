    "Title": "The post on Reddit recounts the author's experience of starting a successful business in 2007 after working for a failing company for 18 years. With 22 years of experience and loyal clients, they were able to work from home and survive the 2008 economic crash. However, the recent rise in costs (up 50% in 2020) has made their business unsustainable, and they are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. Commenters praised the author's resilience and praised them for exploring other options before closing their business. There were concerns raised about the uncertain future and the impact of the pandemic on small businesses. The overall sentiment was empathetic and supportive, with many sharing their own struggles and offering advice. One comment with the most upvotes stated, \"I'm sorry for what you're going through, but it's great that you have a backup plan. Wishing you all the best!\"",
