    "Title": "The Reddit post in discussion highlights a frustrating situation where a customer, who ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\", faced difficulties in returning the item due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed\". The discussion brought up several positive points including the importance of clear and fair return policies, the need for businesses to take responsibility for return shipping costs, and the customer's right to expect a smooth and hassle-free return process. However, the main concerns raised centered around the business's refusal to cover the return shipping cost and their insistence on receiving the item back before processing the refund. This resulted in the customer facing an additional $14 cost and considering a chargeback. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters leaned towards frustration and disappointment with the business's actions. The most upvoted comment aptly stated, \"The business needs to take responsibility for this error and cover the return shipping cost. This is just bad customer service.\"",
