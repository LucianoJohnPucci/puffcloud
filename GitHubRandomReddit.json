    "Title": "The Reddit post raises concerns about Stripe payment processor's practices and their impact on small businesses. Several commenters shared positive experiences with Stripe, highlighting its user-friendly interface and reliable service. However, there is also an increase in \"horror stories\" where businesses have had their funds frozen, been asked for additional due diligence, and even had their access to funds restricted. This seems to be especially prevalent when using Stripe's RDR feature. The main concern raised is the power that payment processors have over small businesses, as they can hold funds and control their access. The overall sentiment of commenters is mixed, with some acknowledging the benefits of Stripe but also cautioning about these potential issues. The comment with the most upvotes expresses frustration with the lack of transparency and accountability from Stripe in these situations.",
