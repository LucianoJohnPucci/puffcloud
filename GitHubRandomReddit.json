    "Title": "The Reddit post expresses concern about an increase in negative experiences with the Stripe payment processor, particularly when enabling the RDR feature. Despite general satisfaction with Stripe's functionality and user-friendly interface, there have been several horror stories of small businesses having their funds frozen or being subjected to extensive due diligence measures, causing frustration and financial strain. The main concern raised by the writer and commenters is the significant power and control that payment processors hold over small businesses, potentially impacting their livelihoods. Overall, the sentiment is one of caution and hesitation towards relying solely on Stripe for payment processing. The most upvoted comment expressed a similar sentiment and highlighted the need for small businesses to have backup plans in case of any issues with payment processors.",
