The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business. The campaign spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, resulting in a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of callers had immediate needs, demonstrating strong buyer intent. While the return on ad spend was decent, at one call every three days, the poster plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve effectiveness. Overall, commenters were positive about the campaign's potential and suggested tweaking to maximize results. The main concern raised was the relatively low number of calls and the need for further optimization.
