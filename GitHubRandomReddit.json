    "Title": "In the Reddit post, users are discussing the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, as presented in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build.\" The general sentiment among commenters is positive, with many acknowledging the potential benefits of buying a small business and growing its revenue by 10% annually over a period of ten years. Some key positive points mentioned include the potential for a significant return on investment, the ability to leverage existing business infrastructure, and the value of diversifying one's portfolio. However, there are also concerns raised about the realism of consistently achieving such growth rates and the potential risks involved in buying an existing business. Some commenters also express skepticism about the specific numbers presented in Deibel's scenario and question which industries or niches would be suitable for this type of business model. The comment with the most upvotes points out the importance of thoroughly researching the business and its industry before making a purchase, as well as being prepared for potential challenges and setbacks along the way. Overall, while there is interest and enthusiasm for the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, it is also important to approach it with caution and a realistic understanding of the challenges involved.",
