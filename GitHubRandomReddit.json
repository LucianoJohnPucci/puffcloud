    "Title": "The Reddit post on r/WorkersStrikeBack discusses the current working conditions and pay for employees in small businesses. The majority of commenters are supportive of workers fighting for fair wages and improved working conditions. They commend the workers for standing up for their rights and bring up the fact that small businesses often exploit their employees with low pay and long hours. Some of the main concerns raised include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses and the idea that increased wages for workers could lead to higher prices for customers. However, these concerns are largely outweighed by the support for workers' rights and the belief that fair pay and treatment should be a top priority. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of solidarity with workers and a call for change. The most upvoted comment states, \"If small businesses can't afford to pay their employees a livable wage, then they shouldn't be in business.\"",
