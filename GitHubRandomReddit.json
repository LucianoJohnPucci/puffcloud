    "Title": "The discussion in the Reddit post centers around a cafe owner who is experiencing a 30% decline in revenue at their 4-year-old cafe and plateauing growth at their 6-month-old cafe, similar to the struggles faced by nearby small businesses. Many commenters share their own experiences and offer potential reasons for the decline, such as the impact of COVID-19 and increasing competition from chain businesses. Some positive points highlighted include the dedication and resilience of small business owners, as well as the importance of community support. However, the main concerns raised revolve around the potential broader trend of declining business for small businesses everywhere, and the lack of government support for the struggling businesses. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of solidarity and empathy, as they discuss their shared struggles and offer words of encouragement and advice to the caf? owner. The comment with the most upvotes reads, \"It's so sad to see small businesses struggle while larger chains continue to thrive. We need more support for our local businesses.\"",
