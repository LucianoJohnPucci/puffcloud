    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the struggles of small businesses and attempts to identify which industries are experiencing genuine growth and profitability, as opposed to those that are opening out of desperation. The author notes that construction and tradespeople seem to be doing better recently. Many commenters agree that these industries are performing well, with some highlighting the support from government programs such as infrastructure projects and homeowner incentives. Others mention the resilience of these industries and the high demand for their services during the pandemic. However, some express concerns about the long-term sustainability of this growth and raise issues such as inflation and the possibility of a housing market crash. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is cautiously optimistic about the construction and trades industries, but there is also a sense of uncertainty and caution. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"I've been in the construction business for over 20 years and I've never seen this kind of demand. It's been a blessing in disguise for our small business.\" This comment highlights the positive growth and demand for construction services, while acknowledging the challenges and uncertainties that may lie ahead.",
