    "Title": "The Reddit post explores the factors that contribute to entrepreneurial success, specifically debating whether it is primarily a result of hard work and strategy or timing and connections. The discussion begins with many commenters agreeing that a combination of both elements is necessary for success, with one stating that it ultimately depends on how one defines success. Some also mention the importance of luck and opportunity in the mix. However, others express concern that there are many hardworking and strategic individuals who still struggle to achieve success due to factors like lack of resources and discrimination. The overall sentiment seems to be one of frustration and discouragement, with some feeling that success in entrepreneurship is only attainable for a select few. The comment with the most upvotes supports this sentiment, saying, \"Entrepreneurship can be a tough road, with many obstacles and challenges that are often out of our control.\"",
