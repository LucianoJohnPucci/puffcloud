The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business. The campaign spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, resulting in a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. While these results were satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), some commenters expressed concern about the low number of calls received (averaging one every three days) and suggested refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness. Overall, the sentiment was positive with many commenters highlighting the campaign's success in generating leads and its potential for future improvement. The top upvoted comment reads, \"Great ROI and good to see the potential for even better results with targeted ad groups.\"",
