    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a small business's return policy and a customer's frustrating experience with attempting to return a $50 item. The post reveals that the small business offers a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" which initially seems positive. However, when the customer attempted to return the item and it was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS, they were charged an additional $14 for shipping. The main concern raised by commenters is that the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, causing the customer to incur another $14 cost. This has left the customer feeling frustrated and considering a chargeback due to the business not honoring their return policy fairly. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is negative towards the business, with many expressing disappointment and disbelief at their actions. The most upvoted comment states, \"That's a shady business practice, I would definitely consider a chargeback in this situation.\"",
