    "Link": "A small UK engineering company specializing in waterproof cables faced difficulties when an overseas customer in the UAE requested a custom product. After successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. The customer insisted on net 60 payments, which the owner found untenable due to the upfront costs of custom work. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still risky for the owner.
