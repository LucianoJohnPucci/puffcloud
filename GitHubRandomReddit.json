    "Title": "The Reddit post in question features a handmade jewelry business owner seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with the owner of a chain of small boutiques. The boutique owner is interested in carrying their products and requires a minimum of 50 units of each design to stock all of their stores, which is causing uncertainty for the jeweler. Most commenters agreed that this is a great opportunity for the jeweler to expand their business, gain exposure, and potentially increase their profit margin. However, they also expressed concerns about the potential increase in production costs and the need to maintain the quality and uniqueness of their handmade products at a larger scale. The overall sentiment of the commenters is positive and encouraging, with many recommending the jeweler to negotiate a fair profit margin and establish a clear understanding with the boutique owner. The comment with the most upvotes suggests setting a higher wholesale price for the larger quantity orders to cover any potential increase in production costs and maintain the value of the handmade products.",
