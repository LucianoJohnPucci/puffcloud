    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the author, in their 40s, successfully managing a side hustle that has outperformed their full-time job for the past three years, and their recent resignation due to declining mental and physical health. Despite a company offer to adjust their schedule and retain them, the author is doubtful of their ability to maintain the same workload with reduced hours. They are now contemplating asking for a raise, even with the possibility of being designated for future layoffs, as they see their current job as the end of their corporate career and value the remote work flexibility it provides. The commenters point out the author's strong work ethic and applaud their decision to prioritize their health. They also suggest negotiating with the company for a reduced workload or part-time work.
