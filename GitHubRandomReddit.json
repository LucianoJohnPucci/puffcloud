The product is well-received in person (e.g., at LVMH Prize during Paris Fashion Week) but faces challenges online due to its unfamiliarity and premium price. The company is focusing on online sales to attract investors and build a retail network but has limited budget for advertising. Efforts include Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google Shopping ads, as well as influencer marketing, which shows promise but is slow and unscalable.

They are open to collaborations and improvements to boost conversions.",
