    "Title": "In this Reddit thread, a small business owner raises concerns about the legitimacy of increased aluminum prices from their suppliers, claiming that tariffs and pricing restrictions have resulted in a staggering 80% price hike. Despite this, commenters largely agree that the price increase is justified, citing various factors such as global supply and demand, rising production costs, and the impact of tariffs on the aluminum industry. Some also point out that supplier colluding or \"padding profits\" is unlikely as it would lead to severe consequences for the businesses involved. However, there are also concerns raised about the potential for the business owner to seek alternative suppliers or negotiate lower prices. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is sympathetic towards the business owner but also realistic about the current market conditions. The top-voted comment concludes by advising the business owner to conduct thorough research and comparison shopping in order to make informed decisions about supplier selection and negotiations.",
