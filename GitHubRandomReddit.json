    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the idea that success comes from taking action, being persistent, and adapting rather than having a perfect plan. Examples of successful individuals such as Conor McGregor, Joe Rogan, and Colonel Sanders illustrate the importance of starting imperfectly, learning from failures, and continuously iterating. Most commenters agree with the message that persistence and embracing the grind are the keys to success, while rejecting the idea of waiting for ideal conditions. The main concern raised is that not everyone has equal opportunities or access to resources to continuously experiment and iterate. However, the overall sentiment is positive, with commenters sharing their own success stories and agreeing with the message of the post. The comment with the most upvotes comes from user u/cengizkemal, who states \"I completely agree with this. Success comes from taking action, not waiting for the perfect opportunity.\"",
