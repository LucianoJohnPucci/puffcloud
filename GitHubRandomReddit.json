    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, a customer shared their frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The customer had ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee but had to pay $14 for return shipping after realizing the item was not suitable. However, due to a delivery issue, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping cost and insisted on receiving the item before processing the refund, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. While some commenters praised the business for having a clear return policy, many expressed concerns about the unfairness of the situation and suggested the customer file a chargeback. The overall sentiment of the commenters was frustration towards the business for not honoring their return policy fairly. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"Businesses should not penalize customers for issues that are out of their control. This is a clear case of the business not upholding their guarantee.\"",
