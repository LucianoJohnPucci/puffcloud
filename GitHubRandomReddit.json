It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and inquires about specific small business niches that might fit this model.",

    "Title": "The post on Reddit discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which proposes the idea of acquisition entrepreneurship through a simplified mathematical example. The scenario suggests purchasing a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example presents the potential of growing the business by 10% annually and selling it for $3-4M in ten years. While some commenters see this as a feasible and potentially profitable strategy, others raise concerns about the realistic growth rate and inquire about specific small business niches that could fit this model. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some expressing skepticism and others considering the idea as a viable option. The comment with the most upvotes suggests that buying and growing an existing business may be a more stable and less risky approach compared to starting a new business from scratch.",
