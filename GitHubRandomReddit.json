    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author argues that businesses should focus on providing excellent services that naturally inspire customer loyalty and positive word-of-mouth, rather than expecting or demanding good reviews. Many commenters agree that genuine customer appreciation comes from solving real problems and that coercion or reward tactics do not generate long-term loyalty. One commenter shared a personal experience of finding a valuable product and voluntarily promoting it to friends.
