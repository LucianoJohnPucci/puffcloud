It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years.

    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel is discussed, which proposes acquiring businesses as a form of entrepreneurship. Using a simplified example, the post suggests purchasing a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) using a personal investment of $100k and a 90% SBA loan. With an annual growth of 10%, the business could be sold for $3-4M after ten years. The post raises doubts about the feasibility of achieving consistent 10% growth over such a long period and also inquires about specific small business niches that could fit this model. Some commenters point out that industries with high growth potential, like technology and healthcare, may be better suited for this approach. However, others express concerns about the risks involved and the difficulty of predicting long-term market conditions. While some commenters are optimistic about the potential for success with this strategy, the majority seem skeptical about its practicality. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"While this approach may work in theory, the reality is much more complex and uncertain.\"",
