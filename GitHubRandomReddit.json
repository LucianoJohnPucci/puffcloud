    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the common misconception among entrepreneurs that a good product will simply sell itself, and solicits experiences and insights from others on the importance of effective marketing and online engagement. Commenters agree that while a good product is crucial, it is not enough to guarantee success; strategy and promotion are equally important. Many shared their own experiences of being let down by the idea that a strong product will sell itself and emphasized the necessity of actively promoting and engaging with potential customers. The overall sentiment is one of frustration with this faulty advice, and a recognition of the hard work and effort that goes into successful marketing. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the need for a comprehensive and well-thought-out marketing plan, stating \"A good product, even the BEST product, will not sell on its own. You need to work at it - spinelessly playing the waiting game doesn't get you the recognition you deserve.\"",
