    "Title": "This Reddit post, posted by the owner of a handmade jewelry business, is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with the owner of a chain of small boutiques. The boutique owner is interested in carrying their products, but is requesting a minimum of 50 units of each design to stock all of their stores. The jeweler, on the other hand, is unsure of what a reasonable profit margin would be as they have never produced high quantities before. Many commenters were quick to praise the jeweler for their handmade and unique products, which could command a higher price point and justify a larger profit margin. However, some raised concerns about the risks involved in producing such a high quantity of products, as well as the potential for the boutique owner to undercut their prices. The overall sentiment of the commenters was one of encouragement and support for the jeweler, with many offering practical advice such as pricing and contract negotiation tips. The top upvoted comment advised the jeweler to establish a baseline cost and stick to it, while also considering potential discounts for bulk orders.",
