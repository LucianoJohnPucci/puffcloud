    "Link": "The author, a sole W2 employee running a one-man marketing agency that recently transitioned from an LLC to an S-Corp, is facing a dilemma regarding expense categorization on the 1120S form. There?s a disagreement between their bookkeeper and tax preparer on how to categorize subcontractor expenses. Historically categorized as \"Contract Labor\" on Schedule C, there is no such option on the 1120S form. The CPA suggests labeling these expenses as \"Other Deductibles\" and setting \"Cost of Goods Sold\" to zero, while the bookkeeper argues they should fall under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (CoGS) due to their direct link to business revenue. The author is inclined to agree with the bookkeeper, who believes that excessive use of \"Other Deductibles\" could raise audit flags. They seek additional opinions on this matter.",
