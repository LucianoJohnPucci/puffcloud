    "Title": "The Reddit post is focused on concerns surrounding Stripe payment processor horror stories, specifically related to small businesses having their funds frozen or being asked for enhanced due diligence, which has been described as being \"held hostage\". The writer has noticed a rise in such incidents, especially when enabling Stripe's RDR feature, and has expressed worry about the disproportionate power that payment processors have over small businesses. The discussion includes a mix of both positive points and concerns, with some commenters sharing their positive experiences with Stripe while others highlight their negative experiences and concerns about its practices. Many commenters express frustration and concern about the lack of transparency and accountability from payment processors, with one commenter asserting that \"payment processors hold all the cards and have all the power\". The most upvoted comment echoes similar sentiments, stating that \"Stripe has way too much control over businesses\" and encouraging small business owners to diversify their payment processing options. Overall, the discussion highlights the need for more transparency and fairness in the payment processing industry and the potential disadvantage that small businesses face in dealing with powerful entities like Stripe.",
