    "Title": "The Reddit post in question reflects on the author's experience running an online business for a year, where they express a mix of disbelief and discomfort at their passive income through automation exceeding what they earned in two weeks at their previous job. While acknowledging the initial effort required to set up the system, they also highlight the disparity between their income and that of friends with traditional 9-to-5 jobs, leading to a perception that the economic system is flawed. The discussion in the comments section largely revolves around the benefits of passive income and the freedom it allows for, as well as concerns about the impact on traditional job markets and the potential for unequal distribution of wealth. Overall, the sentiment is one of awe at the potential for earning through automation, but also a sense of unease about the larger societal implications. The top upvoted comment summarizes this sentiment well, stating, \"It's amazing how passive income can give us such freedom, but at the same time, it also raises concerns about inequality and the flaws of our economic system.\"",
