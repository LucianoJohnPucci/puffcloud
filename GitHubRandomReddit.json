    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author shares their experience of running an online business for a year and reflects on the surreal feeling of earning more money overnight through automation compared to their previous job. Many commenters applaud the author's success and see it as proof of the power of technology and entrepreneurship. However, there is a concern about the fairness of the system, as the author's friends are still stuck in traditional 9-5 jobs while they generate income with minimal effort. This raises questions about societal inequalities and the impact of automation on the traditional workforce. Overall, the sentiment is a mix of admiration for the author's success and concern for the wider implications of automation. The most upvoted comment reads, \"It's great that you found a way to earn more money and have more free time, but it's also important to consider the implications for others in this increasingly automated world.\"",
