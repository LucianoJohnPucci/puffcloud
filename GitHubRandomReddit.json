    "Link": "The post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which outlines the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship by providing a simplified mathematical example. It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and inquires about specific small business niches that might fit this model.",

    "Title": "The post on Reddit revolves around the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel, which presents a simplified mathematical example of acquisition entrepreneurship. The scenario involves purchasing a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) using a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The potential for selling the business for $3-4M after ten years by achieving a consistent 10% annual growth raises questions about its realism. The commenters pointed out that growth can be unpredictable, and niches that fit this model are rare. Some also questioned the accuracy of the figures and the soundness of relying heavily on an SBA loan. However, the majority of the commenters seemed intrigued by the concept and were curious about possible industries that could achieve such growth. The most upvoted comment mentions the need for strong management and a clear understanding of the business before making any investment decisions.",
