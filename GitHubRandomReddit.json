Despite attracting 2,500 visitors, they have only made 2 sales. They face challenges due to the product's unfamiliarity and pricing, and they currently lack budget for physical retail. Although they?ve tested various online advertising strategies with limited success, influencer marketing shows promise but lacks scalability.
