    "Title": "The Reddit post delves into the common misconception that a good product will sell itself for entrepreneurs. The post highlights the need for effective marketing strategies and online engagement to counter this belief. Many commenters shared their experiences and emphasized the importance of having a solid marketing plan and engaging with potential customers to drive sales. They also mentioned the role of branding and having a unique selling point to stand out in a crowded market. Concerns were raised about the potential negative impact of this advice on new entrepreneurs, as it can lead to oversimplification and failure. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that while having a good product is important, it is not enough to guarantee success and must be supplemented with effective marketing and engagement efforts. The most upvoted comment by user u/WittyBusinessMan summarizes this sentiment well: \"A good product may get your foot in the door, but it's a solid marketing strategy and active engagement that will keep you in business.\"",
