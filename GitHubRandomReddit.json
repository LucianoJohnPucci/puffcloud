    "Title": "This Reddit post brings to light a possible issue of fake threads being posted in the smallbusiness subreddit, specifically referring to a solution called Wosily. The top comments consistently mention this solution, and these threads are posted by new accounts with fake post histories that are quickly deleted after being exposed. The suggested solution is to ban any mentions of Wosily and implement measures to prevent fake threads on the subreddit. The key positive point highlighted is that the community is actively looking out for fake content and calling it out. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of implementing a ban and the potential harm it could have on genuine posts mentioning Wosily. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be one of frustration and distrust towards these fake threads and a desire for stricter moderation on the subreddit. The comment with the most upvotes suggests creating a \"verification system\" for accounts posting in the subreddit to prevent fake content.",
