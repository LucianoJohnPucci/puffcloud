    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a customer's experience with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after realizing the item was not suitable, they returned it for $14. However, due to USPS marking the package as unclaimed, the item was returned to the sender. The customer requested a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item first, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Commenters praised the business for having a 30-day return policy and a satisfaction guarantee, but expressed concerns about the lack of communication and responsibility in this specific situation. The overall sentiment is frustration towards the business for not honoring the return policy fairly. The most upvoted comment stated, \"A business that truly values its customers would have paid for the return shipping or at least offered a discounted option. This is not a good customer service.\"",
