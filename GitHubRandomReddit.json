However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy. The business offered a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after the customer returned the $50 item, USPS marked it as \"unclaimed\" and it was sent back to the sender. The customer was frustrated as they had already paid $14 for shipping and now had to pay an additional $14 to receive the item and process the refund. The main concerns raised by commenters were that the business was not honoring its return policy fairly and that the customer should not have to pay for return shipping in this situation. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was that the business was being unreasonable and the customer should be able to get a refund without incurring additional costs. The most upvoted comment stated, \"If a customer returns an item within the return window, the business should cover the cost of return shipping. It's just good customer service.\"",
