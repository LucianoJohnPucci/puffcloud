The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign had a 57% conversion rate, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs booked. While the overall return on ad spend (ROAS) was satisfactory, averaging one call every three days was a concern. Most commenters were impressed with the results and highlighted the low cost per call of $14.28, indicating a strong return on investment. However, some raised concerns about the low frequency of calls and suggested refining the keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for different departments to improve campaign effectiveness. Overall, the sentiment was positive and supportive of the success of the campaign. The most upvoted comment stated, \"Great job! The results are impressive, and it's great to see that most of the callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent.\"",
