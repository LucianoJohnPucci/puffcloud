However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post centers around a customer's experience with a small business's return policy. The post states that the customer ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it for a $14 shipping fee. However, due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed,\" the package was returned to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping costs, insisting on receiving the item before issuing a refund, leading the customer to face an additional $14 cost. The main positive points raised by commenters include understanding the business's need to receive the item before issuing a refund, as well as citing the customer's responsibility to ensure proper delivery. The main concerns are the lack of communication from the business and the added cost for the customer. Most commenters express frustration with the business's handling of the situation, with many suggesting the customer should file a chargeback. The top-voted comment suggests that the business should have made an exception and covered the return shipping to maintain customer satisfaction.",
