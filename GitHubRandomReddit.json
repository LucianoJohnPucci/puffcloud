    "Title": "This Reddit post centers around a jewelry business owner seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a boutique chain interested in carrying their products. The jeweler is unsure of what a reasonable margin is as a handcrafting and designing business, and the boutique owner is requesting a minimum of 50 units of each design for their stores. The key positive points brought up by commenters include the potential for increased exposure and sales, as well as the opportunity for the jeweler to set their own price. However, concerns were raised about the potential strain on the jeweler's resources and the risk of undercutting their handmade image by producing high quantities. The overall sentiment of commenters is cautiously optimistic, with some suggesting the jeweler conducts market research and sets a minimum price to maintain their brand integrity. The comment with the most upvotes advises the jeweler to negotiate a higher profit margin to cover production costs and set a minimum order quantity for the boutique owner to meet.",
