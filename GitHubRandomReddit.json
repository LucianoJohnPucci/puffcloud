Before automating, identify pain points, map out workflows, and follow a 9-step process: eliminate, reduce, simplify, optimize, automate, document, delegate, outsource (if not a core competency), and measure. Only after streamlining and optimizing processes should automation be considered, as it is merely an efficiency multiplier of existing processes.",

    "Title": "There was a general consensus among commenters that automation should be the last step in improving business processes. Many agreed with the article's suggestion to first identify pain points and map out workflows, followed by a 9-step process of eliminating, reducing, simplifying, optimizing, automating, documenting, delegating, outsourcing (if necessary), and measuring. Some positive points raised include the fact that automation can be an effective efficiency multiplier of existing processes and can lead to more streamlined and optimized workflows. However, there were also concerns raised about the potential for automation to lead to job loss and the importance of considering the impact on employees. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that while automation can be beneficial in certain situations, it should not be seen as a solution to all business problems and should only be implemented after careful consideration of its impact. The most upvoted comment expressed the idea that \"automation is only as good as the processes that you are automating,\" reinforcing the importance of streamlining and optimizing processes before automating.",
