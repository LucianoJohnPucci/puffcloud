    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee,\" but after returning it and paying $14 for shipping, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item for a refund, leading to an additional $14 cost for the customer. Many commenters were frustrated and felt that the business was not honoring their return policy fairly, with one top-voted comment stating that the business should have covered the return shipping cost as it was their mistake for not accepting the delivery. Other positive points included supporting the customer's right to a full refund and suggesting opening a dispute with their credit card company instead of a chargeback. The main concerns raised were about the business's lack of customer service and reputation, as well as the negative impact this experience may have on future customers. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was one of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the business's actions, and the most upvoted comment urged the business to take responsibility and honor their return policy for the sake of their customers.",
