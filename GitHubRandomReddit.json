    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the factors that contribute to success in entrepreneurship and whether it is more dependent on hard work and strategy or on timing and connections. Many commenters agree that both hard work and strategy are essential for success, with one user noting that \"hard work doesn't guarantee success, but lack of it almost always guarantees failure.\" Others also emphasize the importance of surrounding oneself with a strong network and leveraging connections to create opportunities. However, many express concerns about the role of luck and privilege in achieving success, with one commenter stating that \"sometimes it feels like no matter how hard we work, factors outside of our control play a huge role in our success.\" Overall, the sentiment among commenters is a mix of determination and frustration, with some feeling motivated to work harder while others are disheartened by the perceived barriers to success. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of persistence and adaptability, with the user saying \"success is a combination of hard work, strategic thinking, and the ability to pivot and adjust to changing circumstances.\"",
