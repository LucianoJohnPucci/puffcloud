The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business. With a budget of $100 over 21 days, the campaign generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, resulting in a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The campaign was successful in identifying immediate buyer intent from most of the callers, and efforts are being made to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for each department to further improve effectiveness. While the overall sentiment is positive, some commenters express concerns about the relatively low number of calls and suggest expanding the campaign to other platforms. The comment with the most upvotes suggests leveraging customer reviews and testimonials to attract more calls and boost the conversion rate.",
