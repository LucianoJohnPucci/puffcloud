While some users acknowledged that these additional costs, ranging from $20-$50 per shipment, were necessary for the companies to cover their expenses, many expressed frustration and concern at the impact on their budgets and ability to continue ordering from the US. Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency and clarity surrounding these fees, as well as the potential for them to disproportionately affect small businesses. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was largely negative and highlighted the financial strain and inconvenience caused by these fees. The most upvoted comment reads, \"This is just another example of big corporations putting profits above the needs of their customers. Small businesses and individual shoppers deserve better treatment.\"",
