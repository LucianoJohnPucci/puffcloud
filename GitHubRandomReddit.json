However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "The original post tells the story of a customer who had a negative experience with a small business's return policy. After spending $50 on an item with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\", the customer returned the product but was charged an additional $14 for shipping. USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and it was returned to the sender. The business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, leading the customer to consider a chargeback. The commenters expressed positive sentiments towards small businesses, but also raised concerns about the fairness of the return policy and the additional cost incurred by the customer. The overall sentiment seemed to be one of frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The comment with the most upvotes expressed sympathy towards the customer and called for the business to honor their return policy and reimburse the customer for the return shipping cost.",
