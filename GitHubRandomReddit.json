    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" which promotes the idea of acquisition entrepreneurship. The scenario presented is where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $200k SDE, invests $100k, and finances the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and eventually sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The post questions the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade and asks for insights on business niches that can support this growth. Several positive points were raised, such as the benefits of acquiring an existing business rather than starting from scratch and the potential for high returns. However, concerns were also raised about the difficulty of achieving consistent growth, the competitive market, and the reliability of the SBA loan. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some expressing optimism and others pointing out the challenges and potential risks. The top upvoted comment emphasized the importance of thorough research and due diligence before making any acquisitions.",
