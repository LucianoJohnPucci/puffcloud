    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship through a financial example presented in Walter Deibel's \"Buy then Build.\" The author considers purchasing a business for $1 million, leveraging a $100,000 investment and a 90% SBA loan, and growing revenue by 10% annually to eventually sell it for $3-4 million in ten years. Many commenters expressed positive thoughts about this strategy, highlighting its potential for high returns and the benefits of leveraging SBA loans. However, some were concerned about the feasibility of achieving sustained 10% growth for a business generating $1.5 million in annual revenue and suggested alternative growth strategies, such as diversification. The general sentiment of the commenters was cautiously optimistic but with reservations about the specific growth assumptions. The most upvoted comment pointed out that the success of this strategy heavily depends on the industry and specific business niche chosen.",
