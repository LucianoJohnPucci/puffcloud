    "Title": "The writer of this Reddit post brings attention to the increasing number of negative incidents involving the payment processor Stripe, particularly in relation to their RDR feature. While Stripe has been praised for its ease of use and affordability for small businesses, commenters have raised concerns about the power that payment processors have over these businesses and their funds. Many have shared their own horror stories of funds being frozen and being asked for additional due diligence, with some feeling as though they are being held hostage. The overall sentiment among commenters is one of frustration and worry about the lack of transparency and accountability from payment processors. The top voted comment brings up the concern of how easily businesses can be shut down without warning or explanation, stating \"It's a terrifying situation for small business owners.
