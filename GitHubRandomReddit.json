    "Title": "The Reddit post in question recounts a small business that offered a customer a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after the customer returned the item and it was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS, the business refused to cover return shipping costs and insisted on receiving the item back before issuing a refund, resulting in the customer having to pay an additional $14. Many commenters expressed frustration with the business, stating that they were not honoring their return policy fairly and that the customer was being unfairly burdened with additional costs. The main concerns raised revolve around the business's lack of customer service and their failure to uphold their own policies. The overall sentiment of the commenters is negative, with many expressing their disappointment and anger towards the business. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"This is a clear violation of the customer's trust and goes against the very essence of a 'satisfaction guarantee.' The business needs to take responsibility and reimburse the customer for all additional costs incurred.\"",
