    "Link": "The author is reading Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which discusses acquisition entrepreneurship. Deibel presents a simplified scenario where one buys a $1M business (with $1.5M in revenue and $200k SDE) using $100k of their own investment and a 90% SBA loan. The plan entails growing revenue by 10% annually and selling the business for $3-4M after ten years. The author questions the feasibility of sustaining such growth over a decade and seeks insights on small business niches that could achieve this profile.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discussing Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" on acquisition entrepreneurship garnered a mix of positive and skeptical responses. The overall sentiment of the commenters was that while the plan presented in the book may seem simple and achievable, sustaining a 10% annual growth rate for ten years is not easy. Many pointed out that external factors such as market conditions and competition could hinder this growth. However, some commenters highlighted the importance of having a solid business plan and a niche market with high demand potential. The most upvoted comment shared personal experience and suggested looking into sustainable and recession-proof industries such as healthcare or renewable energy. Others also suggested diversifying revenue streams and being open to adapting the business strategy over time. Overall, commenters admired the author's ambition but raised valid concerns about the feasibility of the plan in a rapidly changing business landscape. As the top-voted comment states, \"It's possible, but not probable.\"",
