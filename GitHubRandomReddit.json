    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "After reviewing the comments from the Reddit post about a Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, it is clear that the general sentiment is positive. The campaign spent $100 over 21 days, generating 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a conversion rate of 57%. Most callers had immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. The campaign also had a decent return on ad spend and plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for different departments to improve effectiveness. However, some concerns were raised about the cost per call, which was $14.28, and the frequency of calls, with only one call every three days on average. The top comment, with the most upvotes, suggested testing different ad formats and optimizing landing pages to further improve results. Overall, the majority of commenters agreed that the campaign showed promising results and had potential for even better performance with further optimization.",
