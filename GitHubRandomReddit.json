In this model, an individual buys a $1M business (generating $1.5M in revenue and $200k in seller's discretionary earnings) through a combination of personal investment and an SBA loan. The scenario predicts a 10% annual revenue growth over ten years, leading to a potential sale price of $3-4M. The author questions the realism of sustaining such growth consistently and seeks to identify small business niches that could align with this growth profile.",

    "Title": "In a Reddit post discussing Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which presents a simplified model of acquisition entrepreneurship, the author questions the feasibility of consistently sustaining 10% annual revenue growth over ten years in small business niches. The model proposes an individual purchasing a $1M business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200K in seller's discretionary earnings through personal investment and an SBA loan, with potential sale prices of $3-4M. Commenters expressed mixed views on the model, highlighting both positive points and concerns. Some noted the potential for success with a strong business plan and diligent management, while others raised concerns about unpredictable market changes and the challenges of maintaining consistent growth in niche markets. The overall sentiment reflected a divide between those who believe in the model's potential and those who have doubts about its practicality. The most upvoted comment emphasized the importance of having a well-defined business strategy and being willing to adapt to changing market conditions.",
