    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the possibility of video game performers going on strike due to their lack of fair compensation and working conditions. Many commenters applauded the potential strike, noting that it would bring much needed attention to the issue and potentially lead to fairer treatment for performers. Additionally, there was criticism towards the gaming industry for exploiting performers and a call for gamers to support the strike by not purchasing games produced by companies not meeting performer demands. Concerns raised included the potential harm and pressure the strike could put on smaller gaming companies and concern for the long-term success of the strike. Overall, the sentiment was supportive of the performers and the potential strike, with a popular comment receiving the most upvotes stating, \"As someone who grew up with video games, it's really disappointing to see how poorly the performers who bring these characters to life are treated.\"",
