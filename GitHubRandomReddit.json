    "Title": "This Reddit post centers around a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature, which triggered \"enhanced due diligence\" and payment holds despite the business having a successful track record with no issues. The key positive points highlighted by commenters include the potential benefits of RDR, such as quick resolution of disputes, and the importance of Stripe's potential role in preventing fraudulent transactions. However, the main concern raised is the lack of clear communication and generic responses from Stripe support, leading to cash flow problems for the business owner. Commenters also express frustration with the inability to speak with a real person at Stripe for assistance. The overall sentiment of the commenters leans towards dissatisfaction and disappointment with Stripe's handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment states, \"As an established business owner, I expect more from a service provider like Stripe. The lack of communication and generic responses are unacceptable.\"",
