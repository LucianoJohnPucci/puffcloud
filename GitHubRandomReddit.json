After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post details the struggles of a small business owner with declining sales due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, it was found that shipping prices were a major deterrent. However, the business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, and UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses and price hikes, ultimately not helping sales. The owner has also received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but they are seen as untrustworthy. Many commenters offer advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS, with some suggesting the use of third-party logistics providers. The overall sentiment is one of understanding and support for the business owner's struggles, with many sympathizing with the high costs of shipping. One comment with the most upvotes suggests negotiating with FedEx and UPS directly for better rates rather than relying on third-party providers.",
