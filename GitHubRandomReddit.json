    "Title": "There is a growing hype around AI agents, driven by tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, who are capitalizing on businesses' fear of missing out (FOMO). However, many AI solutions are overpriced, overhyped, and lack true autonomy, often being little more than glorified chatbots or basic automations. The author urges businesses to focus on solving real problems rather than chasing tech trends, warning that the current AI agent craze may lead to wasted resources and regret. While the potential impact of AI is acknowledged, the implementation is seen as far from revolutionary and potentially lacking in meaningful benefits, particularly for small businesses.
