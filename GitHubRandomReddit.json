Deibel presents a hypothetical example where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business, investing $100K and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur projects a 10% annual revenue growth, culminating in a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author poses questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth and identifies potential small business niches that could achieve this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "The author is discussing Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which presents the idea of acquisition entrepreneurship. Deibel proposes a scenario where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $100K of their own money and finances the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur predicts a 10% annual revenue growth and aims to sell the business for $3-4M after ten years. Commenters point out that consistent 10% growth may be unrealistic and suggest potential industries for achieving this trajectory. The discussion highlights the importance of thorough research and due diligence before making such a large investment and the need for backup plans in case of unexpected challenges. Overall, the sentiment is cautiously optimistic about the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, but there are concerns about the feasibility and sustainability of the projected growth. The most upvoted comment states, \"This book offers a valuable perspective on entrepreneurship, but it's important to approach it with a critical eye and realistic expectations.\"",
