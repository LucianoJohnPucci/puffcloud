After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",

    "Title": "A small business owner with over a decade of experience is struggling with declining sales this year, largely due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, it was found that nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a major deterrent. However, the business primarily ships via FedEx, which offers no shipping discounts, and UPS has shown to be unhelpful as well. Various attempts to lower shipping costs only resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn't improve sales. The owner expresses concerns about the trustworthiness of Unishippers, even after receiving unsolicited offers from them. The commenters advise the owner to negotiate with FedEx and UPS for better shipping rates, and suggest other shipping options such as USPS and regional carriers. The general sentiment of the commenters is empathetic towards the struggles of small businesses and the impact of high shipping costs on their sales. The comment with the most upvotes suggests considering parcel consolidation services for reducing shipping costs.",
