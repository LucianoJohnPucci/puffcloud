Previously categorized as \"Contract Labor\" on Schedule C, such an option is unavailable on 1120S. The CPA suggests categorizing them as \"Other Deductibles\" with a note detailing the expenses, while the bookkeeper argues this could lead to an audit and advocates for categorizing these costs under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (CoGS) since they are tied to revenue generation. The author is inclined to support the bookkeeper's recommendation for better clarity in reflecting net profit.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author, a one-man marketing agency owner, is seeking advice on how to categorize subcontractor expenses for the 1120S tax form. The post sparked a discussion between a CPA and a bookkeeper, with each proposing different categorization options. The key positive points include the CPA's suggestion to categorize the expenses as \"Other Deductibles\" with a note explaining them, and the bookkeeper's recommendation to classify them as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (CoGS) since they contribute to revenue generation. The main concerns raised are the potential for audit with the CPA's proposal and the lack of clarity in categorizing these expenses with the bookkeeper's recommendation. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is in support of the bookkeeper's suggestion for better reflection of net profit. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"I agree with the bookkeeper, CoGS seems like a more appropriate category for subcontractor expenses.\"",
