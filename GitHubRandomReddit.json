    "Link": "The creator of **everm?e**, a digital locket primarily targeting the US and Canada, seeks feedback on their website and product presentation to improve low conversion rates (2 sales from 2.5k visitors). The product is unfamiliar and in a higher price segment, requiring customer education. Despite positive offline feedback (e.g., at LVMH Prize, Paris Fashion Week), online sales struggle. Limited ad spend ($400) on Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, and Pinterest has yielded minimal results, though influencer marketing shows promise but is slow and unscalable. Key concerns include unclear product communication, lack of size guides, insufficient videos, and potential confusion in the ordering process. Brutally honest feedback is requested to address issues and improve online sales. Collaboration offers are also welcomed.",

    "Title": "The creator of everm?e, a high-end digital locket, posted on Reddit requesting feedback on their website and product presentation in hopes of improving their low conversion rate of 2 sales out of 2.5k visitors. The product is new and requires education for potential customers, making online sales difficult. Despite positive offline reviews at events like LVMH Prize and Paris Fashion Week, the $400 spent on social media ads has not yielded significant results. Influencer marketing has shown potential, but is slow and not scalable. Key concerns raised by commenters included unclear product communication, lack of size guides, insufficient videos, and potential confusion in the ordering process. The overall sentiment was honest and collaborative, with a focus on addressing existing issues and finding solutions for improving online sales. The top voted comment highlighted the need for clear and compelling product communication as a key factor in driving conversions.",
