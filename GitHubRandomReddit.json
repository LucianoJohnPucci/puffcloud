    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author shares their experience of starting a business in 2007, after nearly two decades at a failing company. They were able to leverage their 22 years of experience and client loyalty, and also saved on real estate costs by working from home. Despite the challenges of the 2008 financial crisis, the business survived. The author and their spouse both being self-employed, also made the business more resilient. However, as costs kept rising, with a 50% increase in 2020 alone, the author now finds the business unsustainable. Many commenters express sympathy and offer support, while also acknowledging that the COVID-19 pandemic has been hard on small businesses. Some suggest alternative strategies, such as diversifying their offerings or cutting costs. However, the overall sentiment is one of understanding and encouragement, with many commenters expressing hopes that the author's business will find a way to thrive. The top-upvoted comment highlights the resilience and determination of the author, saying, \"Congratulations on running a home business for 13 years, especially with surviving the 2008 crash.\"",
