    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a smart pet tag business launched in 2021 that utilizes NFC chips and QR codes. Despite significant investment and marketing efforts, the business has only sold 1,000 tags over two years. The main positive points raised by commenters include the potential for a relaunch with new strategies and the market for pet products being continuously growing. However, concerns were also raised about the cost of the tags, the competition in the pet tag market, and the potential need for partnerships with pet stores or veterinarians. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some suggesting a pivot to focus on a niche market or improving the product features, while others advise against reviving the business due to the low sales and high costs.
