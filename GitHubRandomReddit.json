    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The business advertised a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but when the customer returned a $50 item and paid $14 for shipping, USPS marked it as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The business refused to pay for return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing a refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Many commenters praised the customer for trying to resolve the issue with the business before considering a chargeback, while others expressed disappointment in the business's lack of transparency and fairness. The overall sentiment was that the business should honor their return policy and cover the return shipping cost for the customer. The top voted comment stated, \"If the business advertised a 30-day return policy, they should honor it and cover the return shipping cost. Not doing so is going against what they promised to their customers.\"",
