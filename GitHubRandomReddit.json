After successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. The customer insisted on net 60 payments, which the owner found untenable due to the upfront costs of custom work. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still risky for the owner. Ultimately, the owner chose not to proceed with the order, prioritizing peace of mind over financial risk. They sought to hear from others about similar experiences with large companies.",

    "Title": "A Reddit post discussing a small UK engineering company's difficulties with an overseas customer's request for a custom product has garnered a range of responses from commenters. One key positive point is the owner's prioritization of peace of mind over financial risk, as they ultimately chose not to proceed with the order due to unfavorable payment terms. However, many commenters also expressed concern over the customer's insistence on net 60 payment terms and the owner's struggles with negotiating a more manageable net 30 offer. The overall sentiment among commenters is one of understanding and empathy, with many sharing their own similar experiences with large companies and offering advice on how to mitigate risk in such situations. The most upvoted comment offers condolences and support to the owner, highlighting the difficulties of doing business with larger companies and the importance of valuing one's own well-being.",
