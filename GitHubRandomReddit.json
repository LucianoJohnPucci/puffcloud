    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The post discussed the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, where $100 was spent over 21 days and yielded 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. Most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory with a decent ROAS, the campaign averaged only one call every three days. Suggestions for improvement included refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments. The main concerns raised were the relatively low number of calls and the need for further optimization. Commenters had mixed sentiments, with some pointing out the positive return on ad spend, while others expressed disappointment in the low call volume. The most upvoted comment highlighted the need for more targeted ads and the potential for success with further optimization.",
