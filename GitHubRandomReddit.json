    "Title": "Many commenters on this Reddit post expressed frustration and disappointment with a small business that did not honor its advertised return policy. The customer in question ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after realizing the item was not suitable, returned it at their own expense of $14. However, due to issues with USPS, the package was marked as unclaimed and returned to the sender. The customer was then asked by the business to pay an additional $14 to receive the item back in order to process the refund, leading to high levels of frustration and some considering a chargeback. The main concerns raised were that the business was not upholding its advertised return policy fairly, and that the customer was facing additional expenses and inconvenience due to issues beyond their control. The overall sentiment of the commenters was one of disappointment and sympathy towards the frustrated customer, with many agreeing that the business should have covered the return shipping costs. The comment with the most upvotes pointed out the unfairness of the situation and urged the business to make things right.",
