    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concerns of a writer regarding the rise in Stripe payment processor horror stories, where small businesses are facing issues such as frozen funds, enhanced due diligence requests, and being \"held hostage\". The writer has noticed a surge in such incidents, especially when enabling Stripe's RDR feature, and is worried about the significant control payment processors have over small businesses. The key positive points raised by commenters include the convenience and ease of use of Stripe, as well as their quick and efficient customer support. However, the main concerns revolve around the lack of transparency and communication from Stripe regarding the reasons for holding funds, as well as the lengthy and complex process of resolving these issues. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while Stripe has its benefits, there is a need for more transparency and accountability in their operations. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the frustration of a business owner who had their funds frozen for an extended period without any explanation or resolution from Stripe.",
