    "Title": "This Reddit post raises concerns about the increasing number of horror stories involving Stripe payment processor and how it affects small businesses. The writer observes a surge in incidents where businesses are facing frozen funds, being asked for additional verification, and feeling \"held hostage\". These incidents seem to be more common when Stripe's RDR (Risk and Due Diligence) feature is enabled. Some positive experiences with Stripe were mentioned, including its user-friendly interface and fast processing times. However, the main concerns raised by commenters revolve around the power that payment processors have over small businesses, with some suggesting that regulations should be put in place to protect businesses. The overall sentiment of the commenters is frustration and worry about the potential impact on small businesses. The top upvoted comment highlights a personal experience where a small business owner had their funds frozen for weeks due to Stripe's RDR feature.",
