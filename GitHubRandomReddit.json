    "Title": "The post from the author highlights their decision to join an entrepreneur group focused on fast growth and investor funding, but their preference for stable growth and self-funding. They shared their business approach, but were met with criticism for not working enough. However, the author's value for work-life balance and desire to build a business that supports their lifestyle persisted, despite feeling hurt by the critique. The general sentiment from commenters was supportive of the author's choice to prioritize work-life balance and questioned the culture of hustle and burnout often glorified in entrepreneurship. The most upvoted comment echoed this sentiment, stating that \"success should not be measured by how hard you work, but by how happy and fulfilled you are in your business and life.\" Others commended the author for staying true to their values and encouraged them to continue on their business journey without the support of the entrepreneur group, as real success is defined by individual fulfillment and not external validation.",
