    "Title": "The Reddit post discussed a situation where a customer ordered a $50 item from a small business that had a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" However, after realizing the item wasn't suitable, the customer returned it, paying $14 for shipping. Due to USPS marking the package as unclaimed, the item was returned to the sender and the customer was asked to pay an additional $14 for return shipping for a refund to be processed. This has caused frustration for the customer who feels that the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.\n\nMany commenters praised the business for having a 30-day return policy and a satisfaction guarantee, which shows their commitment to their customers. However, others pointed out that the business should also cover the return shipping costs, especially in a situation like this where it was not the fault of the customer. Some also questioned the USPS for marking the package as unclaimed, leading to additional expenses for the customer. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic towards the customer and disappointed in the business for not handling the situation better.\n\nOne comment that received the most upvotes summarized the issue well: \"It's a shame that the customer has to bear the additional costs for something that was out of their control. The business should take responsibility and cover the return shipping to uphold their promise of a hassle-free return policy.\"",
