    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a small business owner who is facing declining sales due to high shipping costs of 30-50 daily shipments. Despite offering USPS and FedEx options, 90% of abandoned carts cite the expensive shipping as the main reason. The owner has tried lowering shipping costs, but this has led to losses and forced them to increase product prices, which did not solve the issue. They struggle to negotiate better rates with FedEx or UPS and are skeptical of third-party solutions like Unishippers due to poor transparency and negative reviews. The main concerns raised by commenters are the difficulty and frustration in finding affordable shipping options and the impact this has on their business.

Overall, the sentiment among commenters is one of shared frustration and empathy for the small business owner's struggle to stay competitive.
