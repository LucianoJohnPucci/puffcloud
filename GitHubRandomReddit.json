The majority of commenters express encouragement and positivity towards the idea of selling, citing the financial benefits and the opportunity to start new ventures. Some also mention the challenges of running a small business and the possibility of selling again in the future. On the other hand, a few raise concerns about regretting the decision and the potential for the app to continue growing and becoming more valuable.

The comment with the most upvotes, from user u/ThatDuck, reads, \"If you?re not financially stable now and you have the opportunity to sell for $2M, I would definitely do it. You don?t know what the future holds and if you can get money to invest in other ventures, you might get another shot with a different app.\"",
