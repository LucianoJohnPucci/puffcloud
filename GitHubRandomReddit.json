    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the struggles of a smart pet tag business that has only sold 1,000 tags over the span of two years, despite heavy investment and marketing efforts. Many users praised the idea and concept of the business, noting its potential in the growing pet market. Some also highlighted the positive aspects of the product, such as its use of NFC chips and QR codes for easy access to pet information. However, the main concerns raised were related to the pricing and marketing strategies used. Some suggested that the tags were too expensive and that the marketing efforts were not reaching the targeted audience effectively. Others questioned the need for such a product, stating that traditional pet identification methods are already widely used. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some expressing hope for a potential relaunch with improved strategies, while others advised the author to move on from the business. The most upvoted comment was by user u/simonthaebo, who stated \"I think the price point needs to be adjusted. Most pet owners won't spend more than $20 for an ID tag, especially when traditional tags are readily available for cheaper options.\"",
