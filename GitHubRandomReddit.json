    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shares their frustrating experience with a small business that has a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" policy. The customer ordered a $50 item, but after realizing it wasn't suitable, returned it for a $14 shipping fee. However, USPS deemed the package unclaimed and returned it to the sender after three delivery attempts. The customer reached out for a refund, but the business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item first, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The main positive points raised by commenters include the fact that the customer followed the return policy and the business initially had good intentions with their policy. However, many expressed concerns about the extra costs and inconvenience the customer has faced, suggesting that the business should cover the return shipping and improve their return process. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business is not being fair and honorable in their handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment states, \"The return policy means nothing if the business doesn't actually honor it and ends up causing the customer more trouble.\"",
