    "Title": "The post on Reddit describes a frustrating situation where a customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\". The customer returned the item after realizing it wasn't suitable, but due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed\", the package was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost.\n\nMany commenters on the post praised the customer for trying to return the item within the return policy timeframe and expressed sympathy for the inconvenience they faced due to USPS's actions. Others pointed out the importance of understanding return policies before making a purchase and suggested that the customer should have chosen a more reliable shipping method. However, the main concerns raised were around the business's reluctance to cover the return shipping cost and their insistence on receiving the item before processing a refund. This, along with the inconvenience caused by USPS, has led to frustration and even discussions of a chargeback.\n\nOverall, the sentiment among commenters was one of frustration and disappointment towards the business for not honoring their return policy fairly. The comment with the most upvotes was from a user who called out the business for their poor customer service and suggested that they should have been more accommodating to the customer's situation.",
