The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign resulted in a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs booked. The post highlights the potential of the campaign, with most callers having immediate needs indicating strong buyer intent. However, some commenters expressed concern over the low number of calls generated (averaging one call every three days) and suggested refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups to improve effectiveness. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many acknowledging the decent return on ad spend (ROAS) but also pointing out room for improvement in the campaign strategy. The comment with the most upvotes emphasized the need for segmentation and targeting different buyer personas in the business's four departments.",
