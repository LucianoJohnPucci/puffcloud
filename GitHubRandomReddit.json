After successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms. The customer insisted on net 60 payments, which the owner found untenable due to the upfront costs of custom work. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still risky for the owner. Ultimately, the owner chose not to proceed with the order, prioritizing peace of mind over financial risk. They sought to hear from others about similar experiences with large companies.",

    "Title": "A small UK engineering company specializing in waterproof cables faced difficulties when an overseas customer in the UAE requested a custom product. The post sparked a discussion among Reddit users who shared their experiences dealing with large companies on custom orders. The overall sentiment was one of understanding and support for the business owner who prioritized peace of mind over financial risk. Many commenters praised the owner for standing their ground and negotiating for better payment terms, and for ultimately making the responsible decision to not proceed with the order. The main concerns raised were the unfair and often unreasonable demands of large companies on small businesses, putting them at financial risk. One commenter shared their similar experience with a large company that also demanded net 60 payment terms, and the owner's decision to reject the order was the most upvoted comment. It seems that many have faced similar challenges and empathized with the owner's difficult decision, highlighting the need for fair and transparent business practices in the industry.",
