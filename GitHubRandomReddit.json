    "Title": "The author of this Reddit post is worried about \"astroturfing\" on the platform ? a practice where businesses or services promote themselves without disclosing their affiliation ? and the potential legality issues, with fines up to $16,000 a day. They propose creating a website to expose these companies and ask the community for support. The discussion gains support from users who highlight the negative impact of astroturfing and the need for transparency in online marketing. Several commenters also suggest implementing stricter rules and penalties on Reddit to prevent such practices. However, others express concern about the feasibility and effectiveness of the website proposal, citing potential legal challenges and the difficulty of identifying astroturfing in some cases. Overall, the sentiment is against astroturfing and in favor of transparency, but there is also skepticism towards the proposed solution. The comment with the most upvotes sums up the general sentiment, stating, \"Transparency is crucial. It's the responsibility of platforms like Reddit to crack down on this type of unethical marketing behavior.\"",
