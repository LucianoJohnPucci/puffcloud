    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a common piece of poor advice given to entrepreneurs - \"a good product will sell itself\" - is being discussed. Many commenters shared their experiences and insights, emphasizing the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement in the success of a product. Positive points included the acknowledgement that having a great product is important, but it also needs to be actively marketed and promoted in order to reach potential customers. Another key point was the need for entrepreneurs to have a strong understanding of their target audience and how to effectively reach them. Concerns were raised about the potential consequences of relying solely on the belief that a good product will sell itself, such as missed opportunities and loss of potential customers. Overall, the sentiment of commenters was that while a good product is essential, it is not enough on its own and effective marketing and engagement are crucial for success. The comment with the most upvotes pointed out that even the best products require some level of marketing in order to reach their full potential, and that relying solely on the product's quality is a risky approach.",
