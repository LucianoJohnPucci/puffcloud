Deibel presents a scenario where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in seller's discretionary earnings (SDE), invests $100k, and finances the rest with a 90% SBA loan. He suggests the business could grow revenue by 10% annually, leading to a sale price of $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% annual growth and seeks examples of small business niches that might fit this growth trajectory.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post in question centers around the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel, which delves into the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship. According to Deibel, acquiring a business for $1M with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in SDE, while investing $100k and securing a 90% SBA loan, could result in a 10% annual growth and a potential $3-4M sale in ten years. While some commenters saw potential in this strategy, others raised concerns about the feasibility of consistent 10% growth and challenges in finding small business niches suitable for this trajectory. The overall sentiment of the commenters seemed to be one of skepticism, with many expressing a need for more concrete examples and data to support Deibel's claims. The most upvoted comment, with 32 upvotes, highlights the importance of thoroughly evaluating the risks and potential obstacles before pursuing acquisition entrepreneurship.",
