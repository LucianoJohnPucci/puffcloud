    "Title": "The Reddit post centers around a small business owner who sells clothes and shoes on Instagram and has recently found a supplier who contacted them directly. The owner has requested exclusivity in their region, but has discovered that the supplier is also messaging their competitors. The main positive points raised by commenters include the importance of having a clear and legally binding contract with the supplier, proactively communicating with the supplier and establishing a good relationship, and exploring other potential suppliers. Concerns mainly revolve around the trustworthiness and reliability of the supplier, as well as the possibility of the supplier breaching the exclusivity agreement. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be that communication and building a good relationship with the supplier is key, but also taking precautions and not fully relying on one supplier. The most upvoted comment advises the owner to \"have a lawyer send them a letter stating that they are in violation of your exclusivity agreement and that further violations will result in legal action.\"",
