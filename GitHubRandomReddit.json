The majority of commenters seem to have a positive outlook on the potential strike, praising the idea of fair compensation and recognition for the hard work put in by these performers. Many also point out the importance of these performers in creating the immersive experiences that gamers enjoy.

Overall, the sentiment towards the strike is supportive and encouraging. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"Unionizing is important in any industry, especially for workers who are often overlooked. It's great to see the performers standing up for what they deserve.\"",
