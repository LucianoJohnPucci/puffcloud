The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the results of a $100 Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls over 21 days with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of callers had immediate needs, indicating high buyer intent. While the campaign had a satisfactory return on ad spend (ROAS), the frequency of one call every three days was a concern. The plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's four departments were seen as potential solutions for improving campaign effectiveness. Overall, commenters expressed positive sentiments towards the campaign's results and acknowledged the potential for optimization. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"It's great to see such a high conversion rate from the calls received. Refining the targeting and creating ad groups for specific departments sounds like a promising strategy to further boost results.\"",
