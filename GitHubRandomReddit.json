It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years.

    "Title": "Reddit users engaged in a thought-provoking discussion on the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship, prompted by the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel. The post outlines a simplified mathematical example of buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in SDE, leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example suggests that consistent 10% annual growth could lead to a sale of $3-4M in ten years, prompting discussions around the realism of such growth and potential niches for this model. While some appreciate the simplified example and the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship, concerns were raised about the likelihood of 10% growth over a decade, especially in today's uncertain market. Additionally, there were inquiries about identifying specific small business niches that could fit this model. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some expressing optimism and others voicing skepticism. The top upvoted comment states, \"While the numbers may be optimistic, the concept of leveraging financing and acquiring a steady, established business with growth potential is definitely worth considering.\"",
