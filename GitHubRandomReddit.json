    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the experience of an author who started their business in 2007 after working at a failing company for 18 years, using their 22 years of experience and client loyalty. The author and their husband are both self-employed and were able to survive the 2008 financial crash by working from home and avoiding real estate costs. However, the rising costs in 2020, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, have made the business unsustainable. They are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor, acknowledging that they were lucky not to have closed in 2020 like many other small businesses. The discussion among commenters largely highlights the author's resilience and ingenuity in navigating difficult times and the importance of having a strong support system. Concerns raised include the precarious nature of small businesses, the struggle of managing rising costs, and the impact of the pandemic on businesses. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is one of empathy and solidarity with the author's situation. The most upvoted comment summarizes this sentiment by stating, \"It's inspiring to see how determined you and your husband are. It's not easy being self-employed, but I'm glad you're still trying to make it work.\"",
