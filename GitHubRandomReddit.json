    "Title": "This Reddit post focuses on the harmful advice often given to entrepreneurs that a good product will simply sell itself, and prompts others to share their experiences and insights on the importance of effective marketing and online engagement. Commenters overwhelmingly agree that while a good product is essential, it is not sufficient for success - instead, businesses must also have a strong marketing strategy and active online presence to attract and engage customers. They highlight the critical role of social media and target audience research in developing effective marketing strategies. Main concerns raised include the potentially damaging consequences of believing in this false advice and the need for entrepreneurs to shift their mindset and prioritize marketing efforts. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of caution and encouragement, with a shared understanding of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and the importance of actively promoting their products. The top comment, with the most upvotes, reads: \"Having a good product is just the first step - without effective marketing and engagement, it's like having a great store in the middle of the desert. No one will know it exists.\" This serves as a reminder of the key lesson from this discussion - that a combination of a good product and effective marketing is crucial for business success.",
