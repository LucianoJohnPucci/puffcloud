    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the struggles of a small business owner who started their business in 2007 after working for a failing company for 18 years. The author leveraged their 22 years of experience and client loyalty to work from home and survive the 2008 crash. Despite enduring the COVID-19 pandemic, the business faced rising costs of 50% in 2020, making it unsustainable. The author and their husband are now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor to keep the business afloat. While many commenters praised the author's perseverance and success in surviving the 2008 crash and pandemic, others raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the business and urged the author to diversify their income sources. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic and understanding, with many sharing their own struggles as small business owners. One comment that received the most upvotes advised the author to \"keep going and never give up, but also be open to new opportunities and don't rely on just one client or source of income.\"",
