The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post discussing a Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, there was a general consensus that the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS) and a high conversion rate of 57%. With $100 spent over 21 days, the campaign generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, resulting in a cost per call of $14.28. Most commenters noted that the campaign revealed a strong buyer intent, with a majority of callers having immediate needs. However, the main concern raised was the low number of calls, with only one call every three days on average. Many suggested refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments as potential solutions. The overall sentiment was positive, with commenters impressed by the effectiveness of the campaign and optimistic about its potential to improve with targeted optimization. The most upvoted comment was a suggestion to implement call-only campaigns for immediate conversions.",
