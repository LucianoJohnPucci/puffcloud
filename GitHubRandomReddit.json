The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating high buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), the frequency of calls was relatively low, averaging one call every three days. The post notes future plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve overall campaign effectiveness. \n\nThe key positive points of the discussion include the successful conversion rate and high buyer intent shown by most callers. The decent return on ad spend is also seen as a positive aspect of the campaign. \n\nSome concerns raised by commenters include the low frequency of calls and the relatively high cost per call. Additionally, some suggest that the campaign could be improved by targeting more specific keywords and optimizing ad groups. \n\nOverall, the sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some acknowledging the successful aspects of the campaign while others suggest ways to improve it further. The comment with the most upvotes suggests using negative keywords and creating separate ad groups for each department to target specific audiences.",
