    "Link": "A small business owner with over a decade of experience is struggling with declining sales this year, largely due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a small business owner's struggle with declining sales due to high shipping costs, primarily through FedEx. After surveying abandoned cart customers, it was found that 90% cited shipping prices as a main deterrent. The owner has attempted to lower shipping costs, resulting in losses and ultimately leading to price hikes that did not help sales. While they have received unsolicited offers from Unishippers, they have found them untrustworthy and are seeking advice on obtaining better rates from FedEx and UPS. Many commenters express sympathy for the business owner's predicament and suggest alternative shipping methods or negotiating directly with the carriers for better rates. Concerns are raised about the validity of the Unishippers offers and the lack of discounts from UPS. The overall sentiment is one of frustration with high shipping costs and a desire for viable solutions. The top comment, with the most upvotes, suggests looking into third-party logistics companies for better rates.",
