    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author expresses their curiosity about the growing trend of individuals selling similar products under different names, particularly through importing goods from China. They mention the case of a company using the RCA brand name for a two-way radio that is essentially a private label product. Many commenters agree with the author's observation and offer their own experiences of encountering similar situations. They highlight the advantages of such business strategies, including low production costs and potential for high profits.

Some suggest focusing on branding and innovation as ways to differentiate from competitors. Others express concern about the impact of this trend on smaller businesses and local economies. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is mixed - while some see the benefits, others raise valid concerns about the consequences of this trend.
