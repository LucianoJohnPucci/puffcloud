    "Link": "The creator of **everm?e**, a digital locket primarily targeting the US and Canada, seeks feedback on their website and product presentation to improve low conversion rates (2 sales from 2.5k visitors). The product is unfamiliar and in a higher price segment, requiring customer education. Despite positive offline feedback (e.g., at LVMH Prize, Paris Fashion Week), online sales struggle. Limited ad spend ($400) on Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, and Pinterest has yielded minimal results, though influencer marketing shows promise but is slow and unscalable. Key concerns include unclear product communication, lack of size guides, insufficient videos, and potential confusion in the ordering process. Brutally honest feedback is requested to address issues and improve online sales. Collaboration offers are also welcomed.",

However, there were some positive points mentioned, such as the potential success of influencer marketing and the willingness to collaborate. The overall sentiment of the commenters was understanding and empathetic, with a desire to help the creator address the issues at hand. The most upvoted comment stated, \"I think the biggest issue here is lack of clear communication about what the product actually is and how it works. A comprehensive video or step-by-step guide would go a long way in educating potential customers and increasing conversions.\"",
