    "Title": "Many commenters on this Reddit post expressed admiration for the author's perseverance and success in starting their own business in 2007, after 18 years at a failing company. Leveraging their 22 years of experience and client loyalty, the author was able to work from home and survive the 2008 crash. However, the author and their husband being self-employed proved challenging, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising costs in 2020, up 50%, rendered the business unsustainable. The main concern raised was the impact this may have on the author's family and financial stability. Despite this, there was a sense of resilience and hope in exploring a part-time contract with a long-term vendor. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic and supportive, with many applauding the author's determination and offering suggestions for alternative solutions. The comment with the most upvotes was from a user who shared their own experience of starting a business during a recession and commended the author for their hard work and dedication.",
