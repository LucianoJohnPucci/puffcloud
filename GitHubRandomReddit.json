By the end of 2017, the business had grown significantly, reaching 16,000 users and generating $1,100 monthly profit. However, by Winter 2018, profits declined due to marketing challenges and increased expenses. After ceasing development to focus on school, the owner sold 90% of the site for $2,200 in Spring 2019. Key takeaways include learning about development, marketing, and entrepreneurship, and ultimately withdrawing over $12,000 in profits from initial investments. The experience fostered a newfound interest in the business world.",
