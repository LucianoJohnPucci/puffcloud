    "Title": "In a Reddit post discussing the impact of minimum wage increases on small businesses, there were various mixed reactions from commenters. The main positive points highlighted were the benefits of a living wage and the potential for increased consumer spending. However, concerns were raised about the potential for businesses to close or reduce staff, as well as the impact on prices for consumers. Overall, the sentiment leaned towards supporting a fair wage for workers, but also acknowledging the challenges for small businesses. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"I understand the struggle for small businesses, but at the end of the day, workers deserve to earn a living wage. It's about finding a balance and making sure both sides are taken care of.\"",
