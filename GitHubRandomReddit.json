    "Title": "The author of the Reddit post is considering starting a security business that targets small businesses, even with their limited budgets. They hope to offer competitive rates, such as $500 for 40 hours, even if it means initially operating at a loss. Commenters were generally supportive of the author's idea, noting that small businesses often face security challenges but may not be able to afford high-priced services. Some suggested offering a tiered pricing structure based on the size of the business, while others suggested finding cost-effective solutions to keep prices low. Concerns were raised about the author's ability to sustain their business with such low rates and operating at a loss. Many emphasized the need to find a balance between affordability for small businesses and financial viability for the security business. The most upvoted comment recommended offering the $500 for 40 hours rate as an introductory deal, with a higher rate for ongoing services.",
