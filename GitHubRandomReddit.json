    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the author reflects on their experience running an online business for a year. They express a sense of surrealism as they earn more money overnight from automation than in two weeks from their previous traditional job. The key positive points highlighted by commenters include the author's entrepreneurial success and the benefits of automation in generating income with minimal effort. However, the main concerns raised revolve around the fairness of the system and the stark contrast between the author's situation and that of their friends who are working traditional 9-5 jobs. The overall sentiment among commenters is a mix of admiration for the author's success and discomfort with the societal disparity created by automation. The comment with the most upvotes reads, \"It's great that things worked out for you, but it's important to remember that not everyone has the opportunity or resources to start their own business and automate it.\" This comment highlights the underlying concern about social and economic inequalities that arise from unequal access to resources and opportunities for success.",
