    "Title": "The Reddit post is a discussion on the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, as outlined in Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build.\" The author presents a hypothetical scenario where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $200k SDE and aims to grow it at a rate of 10% annually, eventually selling it for $3-4M in ten years. Many commenters point out the potential benefits of using a 90% SBA loan and reinvesting profits into the business, as well as the importance of finding the right niche that can support this growth. However, there are also concerns raised about the feasibility of achieving a consistent 10% growth rate over a decade, as well as the risks involved with relying solely on one's own abilities to grow the business. Overall, commenters seem to be in favor of the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, but also acknowledge the challenges and uncertainties involved. The top upvoted comment states, \"The key would be finding a business with potential for growth and having a solid plan in place to achieve it.\"",
