    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a business owner's frustration with Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature, which triggered \"enhanced due diligence\" and caused payment holds despite the owner having a successful and established business with no previous issues. Many commenters applaud the RDR feature for its effectiveness in protecting against fraudulent activities and chargebacks. However, they also express concern over the lack of clear communication from Stripe's support team, which only provided generic responses and caused cash flow problems for the business owner. The overall sentiment is one of frustration and disappointment, as the business owner and other commenters feel that Stripe's support could have provided better assistance. The top-rated comment with the most upvotes highlights the need for Stripe to improve their support system by offering more specific and helpful responses to businesses undergoing enhanced due diligence.",
