    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a German ad about artificial intelligence and its four most commonly used phrases. Many commenters found the ad to be funny and relatable as it highlights the buzzwords surrounding AI such as \"big data\" and \"machine learning.\" There was also appreciation for the use of German language and humor. However, some expressed concern over the oversimplification of AI and the potential for it to be misleading or misinterpreted by the general public. The overall sentiment of the commenters was positive, with many finding humor in the portrayal of AI in popular culture. The most upvoted comment read, \"We programmers understand how AI works. Why can't the rest of the world?\"",
