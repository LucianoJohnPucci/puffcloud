    "Title": "The discussion on this Reddit post revolves around a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The customer ordered a $50 item with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but after realizing it wasn't suitable and returning it for $14 in shipping costs, the USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The business refused to pay for the return shipping, insisting on receiving the item before processing a refund, leaving the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Some commenters praised the business for having a return policy in the first place and for offering a full refund, while others highlighted the lack of transparency and accountability in the business's return process. The main concerns raised were the inconvenience and extra cost faced by the customer, as well as the potential for a chargeback, which would reflect poorly on the business's customer service. The overall sentiment seemed to be frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment stated, \"That's a big red flag for me. The fact that they won't honor their own return policy by reimbursing you for the shipping fee is a sign of poor customer service and a lack of transparency.\"",
