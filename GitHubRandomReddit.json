    "Link": "The post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which outlines the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship by providing a simplified mathematical example. It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and inquires about specific small business niches that might fit this model.",
