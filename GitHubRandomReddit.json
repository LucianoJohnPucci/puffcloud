    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the idea of \"passive\" small business ownership and whether it is achievable or misleading. The author, a small business owner themselves, argues that while hard work is necessary, the right opportunities, systems, and experience can make a business less time-consuming and therefore more passive. This idea is supported by commenters who have experienced or seen examples of successful passive small businesses and believe that it is achievable with effective management through automation and delegation. However, concern is raised regarding the initial hard work and risk involved in setting up a business and the potential for unforeseen circumstances to disrupt the perceived passivity. The overall sentiment of the commenters is positive, with many acknowledging the potential for a business to become \"passive\" with the right strategies and investments of time and effort. One comment, with the most upvotes, emphasizes the importance of finding the right balance between hard work and effective management in achieving a passive small business.",
