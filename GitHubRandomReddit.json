    "Title": "The Reddit post describes a frustrating situation where a customer purchased a $50 item from a small business, with the understanding that they could return it within 30 days and receive a full refund. After returning the item and paying $14 for shipping, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender by USPS. The business refused to cover the return shipping cost and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, leaving the customer with an additional $14 expense. Commenters on the post expressed their disappointment in the business for not honoring their return policy fairly. Many pointed out that the customer should not have to pay for the return shipping since the item was not claimed by them and was returned involuntarily. Others suggested that the business should have offered a pre-paid return label to avoid the situation. The overall sentiment of the commenters was negative, with many expressing frustration and disappointment with the business. The comment with the most upvotes stated, \"The business should take responsibility for the mistake made by USPS and cover the return shipping cost for the customer. That's just good customer service.\"",
