    "Link": "The owner of a handmade custom suit shop on Etsy, a family-run business with 450 sales and $54.8K in revenue, experienced shop suspension due to numerous customer complaints related to overdue orders. Many of these issues stemmed from customers not providing required measurements after placing custom orders. The shop had not received any prior warnings or policy violations from Etsy. Additionally, a dispute with a customer regarding customs fees resulted in a false negative review, leading to further complications. Despite having fulfilled many orders and receiving positive feedback, the owner is facing financial strain due to the suspension and is unable to fulfill pending orders. They express frustration with Etsy's lack of communication and automated responses to their appeals. The situation has caused significant anxiety for the owner, who warns other small business owners to diversify their risks and avoid relying solely on Etsy.",
