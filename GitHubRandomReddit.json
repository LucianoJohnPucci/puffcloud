    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship as outlined in Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build.\" The scenario presented involves an entrepreneur buying a $1M business with $200k SDE, investing $100k, and financing the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The entrepreneur's aim is to grow the revenue by 10% annually and eventually sell the business for $3-4M in ten years. While some commenters were positive about the potential success of this strategy, others raised concerns about the feasibility of consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade. Some suggested that the success of this approach would depend heavily on the niche in which the business operates, with some niches being more supportive of sustained growth than others. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was mixed, with some expressing skepticism while others saw potential in the idea. The most upvoted comment highlighted the importance of thorough research and due diligence before pursuing this strategy, stating that it works better in certain industries and with the right management.",
