    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner shared their frustration with being sued for website inaccessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Despite using an official Shopify theme and approved accessible apps, the owner is facing thousands of dollars in legal fees, without prior notice or opportunity to fix the issue. While some commenters sympathized with the owner and expressed support for potential collective action, others pointed out that websites are required by law to be accessible and urged the owner to make the necessary changes. The overall sentiment was one of outrage towards the lawsuit and a call for responsibility from web providers like Shopify. The most upvoted comment stated, \"I think it's important for business owners to prioritize accessibility and for platforms to ensure their themes and apps are compliant with the ADA. But this lawsuit seems like a money grab and is unfair to small business owners.\"",
