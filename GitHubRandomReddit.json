    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the discussion centered around whether the poster should sell their app for $2 million or continue building it. The majority of commenters saw the potential for growth and advised the poster to stick with the app and aim for a higher sale price. However, some expressed concerns about the app's current lack of profitability and potential competition in the market. Overall, the sentiment was positive and encouraging, with most believing that the app has room for significant growth and that selling it now would be premature. The comment with the most upvotes was from a user who suggested reaching out to a tech investment firm for potential funding instead of selling the app at this stage.",
