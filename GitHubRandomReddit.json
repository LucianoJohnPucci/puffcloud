    "Title": "This Reddit post details a customer's frustrating experience with a small business that offers a 30-day return policy and a 100% satisfaction guarantee. The customer ordered a $50 item, but after realizing it was not suitable, they returned it at their own cost of $14 for shipping. However, due to multiple failed delivery attempts by USPS, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund but was met with resistance as the business refused to cover the return shipping cost and insisted on receiving the item before processing the refund, adding an additional $14 cost to the customer. The main positive points discussed by commenters were the customer's efforts to follow the return policy and their willingness to pay for return shipping. However, the main concerns raised were the lack of customer service and the business's failure to honor its own return policy. The overall sentiment of the commenters was negative as many expressed frustration and disappointment with the business's actions. The top upvoted comment stated, \"This is a perfect example of a company trying to scam their customers under the guise of a return policy.\"",
