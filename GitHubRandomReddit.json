After successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during the onboarding process, particularly around payment terms.

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a small engineering company facing challenges with an overseas customer from the UAE who requested a custom product. Despite successfully agreeing on specifications, issues arose during onboarding related to payment terms. While the customer insisted on net 60 payments, the owner found this unreasonable due to upfront costs. After much negotiation, the best offer was net 30, still risky for the owner who ultimately decided not to proceed with the order. The post garnered a range of responses, with several commenters sharing positive experiences of similar situations and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing peace of mind over financial risk. However, others expressed concern about the difficulties of dealing with large companies and the need for proper payment contracts in place. The overall sentiment seemed to be that the owner made the right decision and should not have to bear such financial risk for a custom product. The comment with the most upvotes was from a user who shared their own experience of a similar situation, offering advice on how to handle negotiations and contracts with larger companies effectively.",
