    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the common piece of advice given to entrepreneurs - \"a good product will sell itself\" - and acknowledges the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement in counteracting this misconception. The discussion highlights positive experiences where engaging marketing tactics have led to the success of otherwise overlooked products. However, it also brings up concerns about the oversaturation of the market and the need for a unique and standout product to truly sell itself. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while having a good product is important, it is not enough to guarantee success in a competitive market, and strong marketing efforts are crucial. The most upvoted comment stresses the importance of not relying solely on the product to sell itself, stating that \"your product is only as good as the amount of people who know about it.\"",
