    "Title": "In this post, a customer shares their frustrating experience with a small business that has a 30-day return policy and a promise of 100% satisfaction guarantee. The customer ordered a $50 item but upon receiving it, realized it wasn't suitable and returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, due to multiple delivery attempts by USPS, the package was labeled as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The customer reached out for a refund, but the business refused to cover the return shipping costs and insisted on receiving the item first, resulting in an extra $14 expense for the customer. Many commenters empathized with the customer, citing the business's unfair treatment and failure to honor their return policy.
