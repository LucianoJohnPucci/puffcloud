    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, the owner of small business Cold Case Gear expressed disappointment with the results of their hired marketing firm. While they had invested a significant amount of money, sales had not improved as expected, leaving the owner unsure of whether to continue working with the firm or adjust their expectations. The small business community offered a variety of advice and insights. Some positive points mentioned include the importance of clear communication and setting realistic goals, as well as the potential for trial and error when it comes to marketing strategies. However, several main concerns were raised, such as the lack of a clearly outlined marketing plan and the possibility of the marketing firm overpromising and underdelivering. The overall sentiment among commenters seemed to be cautiously optimistic, with the majority advising the owner to reassess their goals, communicate better with the marketing firm, and potentially seek out a new agency. The top-voted comment, by u/throwaway_7766, shared their personal experience with marketing firms and suggested focusing on specific marketing strategies rather than a broad campaign. They also emphasized the importance of monitoring and adjusting strategies as needed.",
