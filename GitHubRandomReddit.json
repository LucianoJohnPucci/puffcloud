    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the concerns of small businesses regarding an apparent increase in negative experiences with payment processor Stripe. Many users have shared their own \"horror stories\" where funds were frozen, enhanced due diligence was demanded, and businesses were left feeling \"held hostage\". Several commenters highlighted the spike in these incidents, especially when utilizing Stripe's RDR feature. The main concern raised by users is the level of power payment processors have over small businesses. They feel that these processors can easily freeze funds and put businesses in a difficult position without much accountability. However, some users shared positive experiences, with one commenter stating that their transactions with Stripe have been smooth and they have had no issues. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and concern, with many expressing a need for more transparency and protection for small businesses. The comment with the most upvotes advocated for businesses to diversify their payment processor options to avoid being solely dependent on one company.",
