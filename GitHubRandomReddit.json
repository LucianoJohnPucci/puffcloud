    "Title": "In this Reddit post, users share their experiences and insight into the commonly given but flawed advice that \"a good product will sell itself.\" Many commenters agree that while having a quality product is essential, effective marketing and online engagement are crucial for success. Some key positive points discussed include the importance of building a strong brand and creating a unique selling proposition. However, the main concern raised is that entrepreneurs may become complacent if they rely solely on their product to sell itself, neglecting important aspects such as market research and customer engagement. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is that while having a good product is important, it is not enough to ensure success in the competitive business world. The most upvoted comment sums it up well: \"A good product may get you initial sales, but a strong marketing strategy and continued effort is what will keep you profitable in the long term.\"",
