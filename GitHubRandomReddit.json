Many commenters point out that while a good product is important, it is not enough on its own and that marketing and customer engagement play a crucial role in the success of a business. They share personal experiences where they have seen this misconception lead to the downfall of businesses. Some key positive points mentioned include the importance of a unique selling proposition, understanding one's target audience, and utilizing social media platforms for promotion. However, main concerns raised revolve around the lack of understanding and resources among new entrepreneurs on how to effectively market their products.

The comment with the most upvotes states, \"As someone who has started multiple businesses, I can confirm that a good product is just the beginning. It takes a lot of effort and strategy to get your product in front of the right audience and convince them to buy.\"",
