    "Title": "In a Reddit post discussing the misconception that a good product will sell itself, entrepreneurs share their similar experiences and stress the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement. The majority of commenters acknowledge that having a good product is important, but it is not enough for success. They highlight the need for strong branding, targeted advertising, and consistent customer engagement to drive sales. Some commenters also mention the importance of word-of-mouth marketing and creating a community around the product. However, concerns are raised about the financial and resource constraints small businesses may face in implementing these strategies. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while a good product is a crucial foundation, it is not self-sufficient in driving sales and businesses must be proactive in promoting and selling their product. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"I learned the hard way that a good product alone won't make a profit. You have to constantly be thinking about how to get in front of the right audience and differentiate yourself from competitors.\"",
