    "Title": "The Reddit post in question centers around a one-man marketing agency that is facing a dilemma regarding the categorization of subcontractor expenses on the 1120S form. While the CPA suggests labeling these expenses as ?Other Deductibles? with a statement, the bookkeeper argues that they should be classified under ?Cost of Goods Sold? (CoGS) for a clearer picture of business expenses and to avoid potential audits. The main concern raised is the potential for raising red flags with the IRS if a large portion of expenses are categorized as miscellaneous. However, commenters largely support the bookkeeper's recommendation, citing the need for clear and accurate reporting and avoiding potential complications with the IRS. The comment that received the most upvotes states, \"The bookkeeper is right. You don?t want to raise any unnecessary red flags with the IRS. CoGS is a better fit for subcontractor expenses.\"",
