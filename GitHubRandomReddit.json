    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a handmade jewelry business owner is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with a boutique chain owner interested in carrying their products. The key positive points raised by commenters include the potential for increased exposure and sales for the jeweler's brand, as well as the opportunity to expand into large-scale production. However, many express concern over the potential for reduced profit margins due to the high quantity requirement and possible difficulty in meeting the demand. The overall sentiment of the commenters is cautiously optimistic, with some suggesting the jeweler negotiate a lower quantity requirement or consider partnering with another small business to meet the demand. The most upvoted comment suggests researching the market value of similar products and using that information to negotiate a fair profit margin with the boutique owner.",
