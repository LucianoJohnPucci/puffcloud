They ship 30 to 50 boxes daily, primarily via FedEx, but face high shipping rates that impact profitability. Attempts to lower shipping costs have led to increased product prices, which did not yield positive results. The owner has also been solicited by Unishippers for potential savings but found their representatives untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx or UPS.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post focuses on a small business owner with a decade of experience struggling with high shipping costs and how it impacts profitability. The owner ships 30 to 50 boxes daily primarily with FedEx, but attempts to lower costs by increasing product prices did not have positive results. Unishippers solicited the owner for potential savings, but their representatives were deemed untrustworthy. The overall sentiment among commenters suggested that many had faced similar challenges with shipping costs and offered solutions such as negotiating bulk discounts, finding alternatives to FedEx, or using a third-party shipping company. The top comment with the most upvotes suggested that the owner should consider partnering with other small businesses to negotiate lower shipping rates collectively.",
