    "Title": "In a Reddit discussion about the potential strike of video game performers, commenters expressed both positive and negative opinions on the matter. Many supported the idea of a strike, citing the lack of recognition and proper compensation for voice actors and motion capture performers in the industry. Others pointed out that this is a necessary step towards unionizing and having better representation for these performers. However, some main concerns raised were the potential impact on the industry and the availability of non-union talent to fill the roles. Commenters also expressed frustration with video game companies prioritizing profits over the well-being of their workers. This led to an overall sentiment of support for the strike and a desire for better treatment of video game performers. The most upvoted comment encapsulated this sentiment, stating, \"It's sad that it has to come to a strike for these performers to get the recognition and compensation they deserve. Hopefully, this will bring about positive change in the industry.\"",
