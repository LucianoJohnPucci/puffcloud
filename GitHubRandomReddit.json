    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the misconception that owning a small business is a passive endeavor. The author, a small business owner working 70+ hours a week, counters this viewpoint by emphasizing the importance of implementing systems, automation, and delegation to focus on high-leverage tasks. They argue that true \"passive\" ownership requires strategic effort, not neglect. The discussion largely agrees with the author's perspective, highlighting the benefits of leveraging technology and delegating tasks to achieve a better work-life balance. However, some concerns are raised about the sustainability and feasibility of implementing these methods, particularly for smaller businesses. Despite this, the overall sentiment is positive towards the idea of using systems and delegation to create a more manageable workload for small business owners. One commenter, with the most upvotes, adds to the conversation by stating, \"Small business owners need to understand the importance of working smarter, not harder. Implementing these strategies is crucial for long-term success.\"",
