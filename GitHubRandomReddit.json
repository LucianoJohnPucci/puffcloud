    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the misconception that small businesses can operate completely passively, with the author, a small business owner who works over 70 hours a week, challenging this notion. While some business models may allow for less time commitment through effective systems and delegation, the author emphasizes that this does not mean complete disengagement. Instead, they advocate for focusing on high-leverage tasks to create a more efficient workload. Commenters generally agree with this perspective, with many sharing their own experiences of the constant dedication required to run a successful business. The most upvoted comment states, \"I've learned that 'work-life balance' is a myth in the small business world. It's about finding the right balance for you and your business, but there will always be a level of commitment and involvement.\" Some commenters also raise concerns about the toll this workload can take on a person's mental and physical well-being. Overall, the sentiment is that while it may not be possible to have a completely passive small business, there are ways to streamline and optimize workload to make it more manageable.",
