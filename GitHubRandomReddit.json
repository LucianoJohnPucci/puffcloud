    "Title": "In this Reddit post on Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" and the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, the author outlines a hypothetical scenario where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $200k SDE, invests $100k, and finances the remaining amount with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The discussion around this scenario has a mix of positive and skeptical views. Some commenters see potential in the plan and share success stories of consistently achieving similar growth rates over a decade. Others raise concerns about the feasibility of consistently hitting a 10% growth rate, especially in certain business niches. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with many acknowledging that achieving such growth requires a lot of work and luck. Among the top comments, the one with the most upvotes points out the importance of diversifying the investment and not solely relying on the growth of one business.",
