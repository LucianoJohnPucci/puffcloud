    "Title": "The Reddit post in question discusses the factors that contribute to entrepreneurship success, with some users asserting that hard work and strategy are key, while others argue that timing and connections play a larger role. Many commenters agree that a combination of these factors is necessary for success, with some citing personal experiences or the experiences of successful entrepreneurs as evidence. However, others express concern that success seems elusive and unattainable for many, with systemic barriers and luck playing a significant role. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and disillusionment, with many feeling that the system is not equitable and that success is largely dependent on factors out of their control. The most-upvoted comment is one that argues that luck and timing can make or break a venture, saying \"Luck is a HUGE factor. The right product at the right time can make millionaires out of people who would have otherwise failed.\"",
