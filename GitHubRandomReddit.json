    "Link": "A social media manager was hired by a struggling family-owned organic grocer after their income declined post-pandemic. Despite their efforts, none of their drafted social media posts were approved, as the owners view social media as a casual platform rather than a marketing tool. Additionally, the manager's outside sales efforts have not led to significant results, leading to frustration over the owners' expectations. Feeling uncertain about how to navigate the situation, they consider creating a presentation to educate the owners on the potential benefits of social media without coming across as overstepping their role. They seek advice from peers but are met with little guidance.",
