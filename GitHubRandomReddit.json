    "Title": "The discussion on the legitimacy of aluminum price increases centers on the question of whether suppliers are justified in their claims of 80% price hikes, citing tariffs and industry pricing restrictions. The overall sentiment of the commenters seems to be that the claims may be exaggerated and potentially driven by collusion among suppliers to pad profits. Multiple commenters point to evidence such as stable aluminum prices in other markets and reports from other small business owners contradicting the claims. Concerns were also raised over the lack of transparency and communication from suppliers, as well as the potential negative impact on small businesses. The top-rated comment with the most upvotes states, \"I highly doubt that the 80% price increase is solely due to tariffs. Seems like suppliers may be trying to take advantage of the situation.\"",
