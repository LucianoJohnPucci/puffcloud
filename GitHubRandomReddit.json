    "Title": "In a recent Reddit post, a business owner with nine years of experience expressed their struggle to sell their company, despite price reductions and a new broker, after it has been on the market for nine months with no success. Seeking advice from the community, they inquired about continuing to work with the broker, exploring creative selling strategies, and the feasibility of an employee buyout. Additionally, they asked about options for closing the business if selling proves to be unviable and potential buyer targets, while also emphasizing their desire to be fairly compensated for their investment of time and effort. The main positive points raised in the discussion centered around the owner's determination and willingness to explore different options before closing the business. However, concerns were raised about the current market conditions and the owner's pricing strategy. The overall sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic and supportive, with many sharing their own experiences and advice. The most upvoted comment advised the owner to consult with a professional consultant or broker who specializes in selling businesses to help navigate the situation.",
