The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The topic of this post on Reddit focuses on a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions with a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The majority of the commenters agree that the campaign yielded satisfactory results with a good return on ad spend (ROAS) and revealed a high level of buyer intent from most callers. However, the main concern raised was the relatively low number of calls received (one call every three days) and the need for further optimization by refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups. The overall sentiment of the commenters is positive, recognizing the success of the campaign while also offering suggestions for improvement. The top-rated comment highlights the need for continuous optimization, stating, \"It's a good start. Now keep rolling up your sleeves and optimize the campaign!\"",
