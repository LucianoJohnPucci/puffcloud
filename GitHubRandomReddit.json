They support the idea of banning all mentions of Wosily to prevent further fake threads from being posted. Some suggest implementing stricter account verification measures to avoid such spamming incidents.\n\nMain Concerns:\nSome commenters express concern about the effectiveness of a Wosily ban, arguing that it could potentially restrict genuine discussions about the solution.
