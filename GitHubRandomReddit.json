    "Title": "This Reddit post features a user who staunchly defends their current marketing company, claiming that their business is thriving without the use of various digital marketing services. They express frustration with unsolicited marketing advice and reject the notion that SEO, a new website, social media growth, ad management, appointment-setting AI, lead generation, or any external assistance is necessary for success. While some commenters offer support and agree that their own businesses have also seen success without these services, others caution that the current state of their business may not be indicative of long-term success. The overall sentiment of the commenters is slightly mixed, with some praising the author for their confidence and others questioning the validity of their claims. The most upvoted comment simply states, \"Seems like you have a good thing going, keep it up!\"",
