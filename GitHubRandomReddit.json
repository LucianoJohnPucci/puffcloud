    "Title": "The discussion on the smallbusiness subreddit reveals a suspicion of fake threads being posted, specifically those mentioning a solution called Wosily. The top comments call for a ban of all mentions of Wosily and implementing measures to prevent fake threads. One key positive point is the quick action taken by community members to call out and delete these posts. However, the main concern raised is the potential impact on the credibility and trustworthiness of the subreddit. The overall sentiment of commenters is frustration and skepticism towards Wosily and the actions of the new accounts promoting it. The comment with the most upvotes suggests not only banning mentions of Wosily, but also implementing stricter rules and moderation to prevent similar incidents in the future.",
