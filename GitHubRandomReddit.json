The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls. The campaign had a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%, with 4 out of 7 calls leading to jobs booked. The main positive points raised by commenters include the satisfactory returns on ad spend, the indication of buyer intent from the callers' immediate needs, and future plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's four departments for better campaign effectiveness. Some concerns mentioned are the relatively low frequency of calls (an average of one call every three days) and the potential for the client's four departments to compete against each other in the ad groups. However, the overall sentiment among commenters is positive, with many praising the campaign's success and offering helpful suggestions for improvement. The comment with the most upvotes highlights the importance of keyword targeting, as it can significantly impact the success of the campaign.",
