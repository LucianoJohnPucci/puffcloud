    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses Walter Deibel's concept of acquisition entrepreneurship, where an entrepreneur buys a $1M business with $200k SDE, invests $100k, and finances the rest with a 90% SBA loan. The goal is to grow the business's revenue by 10% annually and sell it for $3-4M in ten years. While some commenters are optimistic about this strategy, others express concerns about consistently achieving a 10% growth rate over a decade. Some suggest that this growth rate may be feasible in certain niches, such as technology or healthcare. Others question the sustainability of such growth and the potential impact of economic downturns or industry disruptions. Overall, the commenters acknowledge the potential success of this approach, but also caution about the challenges and uncertainties involved. The most upvoted comment states, \"It's definitely possible to achieve a 10% growth rate, but it also depends on the industry and economic conditions. Do thorough research and have a solid plan in place before taking such a risk.\"",
