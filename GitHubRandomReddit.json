Before automating, identify pain points, map out workflows, and follow a 9-step process: eliminate, reduce, simplify, optimize, automate, document, delegate, outsource (if not a core competency), and measure.

    "Title": "Automation has become a popular topic in the business world, but many Reddit users agree that it should not be the first step in improving processes. The majority of commenters suggest that before implementing automation, it is essential to identify pain points, map out workflows, and follow a 9-step process that includes steps such as eliminating, reducing, simplifying, and optimizing processes. Automation should only be considered after streamlining and optimizing processes, as it is merely an efficiency multiplier of existing processes. While most users agree that automation can be beneficial, some express concerns about the cost and potential job loss. However, the overall sentiment is that automation should be the last step and not the first in improving business processes.
