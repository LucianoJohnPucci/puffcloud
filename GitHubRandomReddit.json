    "Title": "The discussion in this Reddit post revolves around a business owner who activated Stripe's Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR) feature but faced unexpected payment holds and \"enhanced due diligence\" procedures despite having a successful, established business with no prior issues. The post has elicited a mixed response from commenters, with some highlighting the positives of Stripe's RDR feature, such as its ability to quickly resolve disputes. However, many are concerned about the lack of clear communication from Stripe's support team, with generic responses leading to frustration and causing cash flow problems for the business owner. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while Stripe's RDR feature has its benefits, the lack of transparency and communication from the support team is a major drawback. The most upvoted comment expresses frustration at the situation, stating, \"It's extremely concerning that Stripe's support team is not providing clear and specific responses, causing unnecessary delays and problems for business owners.\"",
