    "Title": "This Reddit post from r/WorkersStrikeBack discusses the experience of small business owners during the ongoing worker strikes. Many commenters expressed support for the workers' demands for fair wages and better working conditions, with some even sharing their own stories of being underpaid and overworked. However, others raised concerns about how these strikes may negatively impact small businesses, with some suggesting alternative solutions such as implementing a minimum wage policy. Overall, the sentiment among commenters was one of solidarity with the workers, but also a recognition of the challenges faced by small businesses. The top upvoted comment, with over 1,000 upvotes, echoes this sentiment, stating, \"We need to support both the workers and the small businesses. This is not an either/or situation.\"",
