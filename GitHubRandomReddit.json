    "Link": "The post discusses Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" which outlines the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship by providing a simplified mathematical example. It suggests buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE), leveraging a $100k personal investment and a 90% SBA loan. The example posits that, by growing the business revenue by 10% annually, one could sell it for $3-4M in ten years. The author raises questions about the realism of consistent 10% growth over a decade and inquires about specific small business niches that might fit this model.",

    "Title": "Many commenters on this Reddit post are intrigued by Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build\" and the potential for acquisition entrepreneurship it presents. The simplified mathematical example of buying a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue, $200k in SDE, and leveraging a $100k investment and 90% SBA loan has caught their attention. The example also suggests growing the business by 10% annually, which could lead to a sale of $3-4M in ten years. Some positive points highlighted by the commenters include the low initial investment required and the potential for significant returns. However, there are also concerns raised about the sustainability of consistent 10% growth over a decade and the specific small business niches that may fit into this model. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is cautiously optimistic, with some expressing interest in learning more about potential niches and others questioning the feasibility of such a strategy. The comment with the most upvotes is one that raises the question of how many businesses have actually been successful using this approach.",
