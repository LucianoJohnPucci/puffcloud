    "Title": "In the Reddit post, the author discusses the book \"Buy then Build\" by Walter Deibel and the concept of acquisition entrepreneurship. The post outlines a hypothetical scenario where a $1M business with $1.5M in revenue and $200k in seller's discretionary earnings (SDE) is acquired with a $100k investment and a 90% SBA loan, with an expected 10% annual growth rate and a potential sale price of $3-4M in ten years.
