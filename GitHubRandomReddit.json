    "Link": "The owner of a custom suit shop on Etsy, with $54.8K in revenue and over 450 sales, faced a shop suspension due to numerous case requests from buyers. Despite actively communicating with customers for their measurements and offering video consultations, about 20-25 orders were overdue because some customers did not provide necessary information. The owner reported a previous false review from a dissatisfied customer as a potential issue, but they had no prior warnings from Etsy. With multiple active orders and significant financial stakes, the owner expressed distress over the situation and criticized Etsy for their decision, while highlighting reliance on their handmade product ethos. They are awaiting an appeal response but feel overwhelmed by the circumstances.",
