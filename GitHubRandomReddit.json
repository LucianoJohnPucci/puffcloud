Despite a history of handmade products and attempts to communicate with customers about overdue custom orders, Etsy suspended the shop without prior warnings. The suspension was triggered by customers opening cases due to overdue orders, leading to immediate refunds from Etsy. The owner suspects a false review from a dissatisfied customer and points out inconsistencies in Etsy's enforcement, such as other shops using stolen images remaining active. The situation has caused severe anxiety, as they have outstanding orders, employees to support, and significant materials on hand. The owner expresses frustration with Etsy's policies and urges caution for other small businesses reliant on the platform.",
