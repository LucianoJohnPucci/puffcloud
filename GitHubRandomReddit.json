    "Link": "The owner of a handmade custom suit shop on Etsy faces suspension after their shop, which had generated $54.8K in revenue and 450 sales, received numerous case open requests from buyers due to overdue orders. The delay mainly stemmed from customers not providing necessary measurements for custom suits. Despite offering detailed sizing guides and video consultations, 55 active orders remain in limbo. The owner had previously argued with a dissatisfied customer, leading to a negative review that triggered a warning from Etsy. They have filed an appeal but received only automated responses. The suspension has caused significant distress, as many customers expected suits for important events. The owner cautions others against relying solely on Etsy for their businesses.",
