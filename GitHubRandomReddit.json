    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the concerns of an importer of Asian products who primarily serves B2B clients and is worried about the potential impact of tariffs on their business. The key positive points raised by commenters include the fact that the business already operates at a premium price point, which may mitigate the effects of potential tariffs. Some commenters also suggest exploring alternative sourcing options or negotiating with suppliers to minimize the impact. However, the main concerns raised revolve around the unpredictability of tariffs and the potential for an overall increase in prices for consumers. The overall sentiment of commenters is one of understanding and empathy for the author's situation, with many sharing similar concerns and offering practical advice. The comment with the most upvotes suggests diversifying the product range to include non-Asian products as a way to reduce dependence on Asian imports and mitigate potential tariff impacts.",
