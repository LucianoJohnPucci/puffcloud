    "Title": "In this Reddit thread, a handmade jewelry business owner is seeking advice on negotiating a profit margin with the owner of a chain of small boutiques who wants to carry their products. The majority of commenters support the opportunity, highlighting the potential for increased exposure and sales. Many advise the jeweler to negotiate for a higher profit margin, as traditional brick and mortar retailers tend to mark up products significantly. Concerns are raised about maintaining the quality and uniqueness of the handcrafted items while scaling up production to meet the boutique owner's minimum unit requirement. Some also caution against being too reliant on one client. The overall sentiment is positive, with commenters offering helpful tips and suggestions for the jeweler to consider. The comment with the most upvotes suggests researching the average profit margins for similar products and using that as a starting point for negotiating.",
