After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a reason for not completing their purchases. Although they offer competitive USPS and FedEx options, the author's reliance on FedEx for larger shipments is financially burdensome, as UPS refuses to offer discounts. Efforts to reduce shipping costs have led to increased product prices, which have not improved sales. The author is frustrated with Unishippers' lack of transparency and seeks advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx or UPS.",
