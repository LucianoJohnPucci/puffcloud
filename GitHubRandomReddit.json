The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

The campaign spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, resulting in a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57%. The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, showing strong buyer intent. While the return on ad spend (ROAS) was decent, averaging one call every three days, there are plans to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups for the client's departments. Overall, the commenters were impressed with the results and saw potential for improvement through targeted ad groups. However, there were concerns raised about the high cost per call and the low frequency of calls. Ultimately, the sentiment was positive with an overall satisfaction with the campaign results. The comment with the most upvotes was about the potential for targeted ad groups to further improve the campaign's effectiveness.",
