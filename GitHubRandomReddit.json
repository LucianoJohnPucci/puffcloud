    "Title": "The post discusses the challenges of starting a security business targeting small businesses with limited budgets. Many commenters support the idea of offering competitive rates, such as $500 for 40 hours, as a way to attract clients and build a customer base, even if it means operating at a loss initially. They also suggest finding creative ways to cut costs and offer value-added services to differentiate from competitors. However, concerns are raised about the feasibility of sustaining the business in the long run and the potential for undercutting the market. Overall, the commenters are supportive and encourage the author to carefully consider the pricing strategy and continuously reassess as the business grows. The most upvoted comment advises the author to conduct thorough market research and consider partnerships or targeting larger clients to supplement the lower rates for small businesses.",
