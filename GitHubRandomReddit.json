They employ five hourly workers, one of whom is underperforming and has expressed a desire for paid time off (PTO) and holidays, potentially threatening to quit. The author is hesitant to offer PTO due to financial constraints and feels that any benefits given to one employee must be extended to all. They seek advice on handling the situation and whether it's common for hourly employees to lack PTO. The highest-paid employee works 36 hours a week at $20/hour, while others earn $17/hour part-time, with each receiving some tips.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the struggles of a small business owner and their concerns about an underperforming employee who has requested benefits such as paid time off. Most commenters agree that it is not uncommon for hourly workers to lack PTO, but suggest that offering some form of benefits could improve employee morale and retention. Many also suggest addressing the underperforming employee through a performance review or setting clear expectations. The overall sentiment is one of empathy for the financial constraints of the business owner, while also acknowledging the importance of taking care of employees. The most upvoted comment advises the OP to communicate openly with the underperforming employee and consider offering incentives instead of traditional benefits.",
