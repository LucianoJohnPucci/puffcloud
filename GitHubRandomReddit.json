    "Title": "The Reddit post highlights a customer's frustration with a small business that offers a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee policy. The customer ordered a $50 item but found it unsuitable and returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and returned to the sender after three delivery attempts. The business refused to pay for return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. Many commenters agreed that the business was not honoring its return policy fairly, with some suggesting that the business should cover the return shipping cost since it was not the customer's fault. The overall sentiment of the commenters is frustration and disappointment with the business's handling of the situation. The most upvoted comment states, \"If a business offers a return policy, they should honor it without causing extra costs for the customer.\"",
