    "Title": "In a Reddit post, a small UK engineering company faced challenges when an overseas customer from the UAE requested a custom product. The customer insisted on net 60 payment terms, which the owner found unfeasible due to upfront costs. After negotiations, the best offer was still too risky for the owner, leading them to prioritize peace of mind over potential profits. Commenters shared similar experiences with large companies, with some pointing out positive outcomes and successful compromises. However, the main concern was the imbalance of power between small businesses and large corporations, leading to unfair terms and potential financial risks. The overall sentiment was one of frustration and understanding, with many sympathizing with the owner's difficult decision.
