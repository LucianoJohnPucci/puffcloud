The conversation held a mix of positive points and concerns. Some commenters pointed out that the company has the advantage of serving a niche market, allowing for potential price increases to offset the impact of tariffs. Others highlighted the importance of diversifying their supply chain and exploring alternative sourcing options. On the other hand, many expressed concerns over the potential loss of clients and decrease in demand due to the higher prices. The overall sentiment among the commenters was cautious and apprehensive, with many suggesting keeping a close eye on the situation and being proactive in finding solutions. The comment with the most upvotes suggested diversifying their customer base to include a mix of B2B and B2C clients to mitigate the effects of tariffs.",
