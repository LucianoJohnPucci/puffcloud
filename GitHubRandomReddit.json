    "Title": "As a leading AI analysis expert, I have carefully reviewed and analyzed the comments on a Reddit post by a small business owner experiencing a decline in sales due to high shipping costs. The majority of the 90% of cart abandoners cited shipping prices as the main deterrent, despite the owner's efforts to negotiate discounts with USPS and FedEx. The main concerns raised by commenters include the uncooperative nature of UPS, difficulty in securing better rates with FedEx or UPS, and unsolicited offers from companies like Unishippers with a history of poor transparency and negative reviews. Overall, the sentiments of the commenters reflect frustration and disappointment with the high shipping costs and lack of options for better rates. The comment with the most upvotes suggests considering alternative shipping companies such as DHL, as they offer competitive rates and better customer service.",
