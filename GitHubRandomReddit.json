    "Title": "The post on the Reddit forum raises concerns about Stripe's increasing tendency to freeze accounts and demand additional due diligence, causing small business owners to feel trapped and unable to fully operate their business. While some users experienced issues when enabling Stripe's RDR feature, others question if this is a growing trend or simply confirmation bias. The community is worried about the excessive power that payment processors hold over small businesses. Some positive comments recognize Stripe for their transparency and proactive communication, while others highlight their efficient payment processing system. However, the main cause of concern is the impact on small businesses and their ability to operate without interruption. There is a growing sentiment that payment processors, like Stripe, have too much control and are able to hold small businesses hostage. The top upvoted comment notes the need for regulations to protect small businesses against the power of payment processors.",
