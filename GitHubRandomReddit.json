However, there are also concerns raised about the cost of upgrading to 4K gaming, as well as the need for powerful hardware and a high budget. Many commenters also express frustration with the constant push for new technology and the feeling of constantly needing to upgrade. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with a majority agreeing with the challenges of 4K gaming but also expressing concerns about the cost and necessity of constantly upgrading.
