    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer shared their experience with a small business that had a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" policy. The customer ordered a $50 item and upon realizing it wasn't suitable, returned it, paying $14 for shipping. Unfortunately, due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, it was returned to the sender. The business refused to pay for the return shipping, insisting on receiving the item before processing a refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. Commenters praised the business's return policy but also pointed out the flaw of requiring the item to be returned before refunding, stating it defeats the purpose of a satisfaction guarantee. Many expressed frustration with the customer's predicament and recommended issuing a chargeback. The overall sentiment was that the business was not handling the situation fairly and should have covered the return shipping cost. The most upvoted comment stated, \"A satisfaction guarantee only holds weight if a business is willing to stand behind it and absorb the costs, not push additional fees onto the customer.\"",
