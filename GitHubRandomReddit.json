After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",

    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner with 10+ years of experience is struggling with declining sales due to high shipping costs. After conducting a survey, it was found that 90% of abandoned cart customers cited shipping prices as a main deterrent. However, the business primarily uses FedEx for shipping, as UPS does not offer discounts for packages exceeding a cubic foot. The owner has tried to lower shipping costs but ended up with losses, leading to price increases that did not improve sales. They have also received offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. Many commentators suggest negotiating with FedEx and UPS for better shipping rates, while also exploring alternative shipping options such as USPS. Some express skepticism about Unishippers' reliability. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that the business owner should not solely rely on one shipping company and should consider diversifying their shipping methods. The top-rated comment advises the owner to reach out to FedEx directly and negotiate for better rates, as they have been successful in doing so for their own business.",
