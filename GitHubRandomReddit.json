    "Title": "The Reddit post in r/WorkersStrikeBack discusses the recent backlash against small businesses following the announcement of a proposed minimum wage increase. The majority of commenters show strong support for workers' rights and the importance of fair wages. Many point out the hypocrisy of small business owners who advocate for free market principles yet refuse to pay their employees a living wage. Other positive points include the need for government intervention to address income inequality and the importance of small business owners taking responsibility for their employees' well-being. However, there are concerns raised about potential job losses and the impact on small businesses already struggling due to the pandemic. The overall sentiment is one of frustration towards the argument that increasing wages will be detrimental to small businesses, with many commenters advocating for fair compensation for workers. The most upvoted comment comes from a small business owner who acknowledges the tough decision they face but ultimately supports paying their employees a living wage.",
