    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a small business owner challenges the belief that owning a small business can be a passive endeavor. They argue that, with the right opportunities, systems, and experience, it is possible to significantly reduce the workload by focusing on high-leverage tasks and utilizing effective automation and delegation rather than neglecting the business for extended periods. The author highlights the importance of being intentional and strategic in managing a small business, rather than relying on the notion of being a \"passive owner.\" The commenters largely support this perspective, emphasizing the need for hard work, dedication, and smart decision-making in running a successful business. Many also raise the concern of burnout and the potential dangers of neglecting the business. The overall sentiment is that owning a small business requires effort and engagement, but with the right approach, it can be fulfilling and rewarding. The most upvoted comment reflects this sentiment, stating, \"Running a business is like a marathon, not a sprint ? it takes consistent effort and discipline to succeed.\"",
