    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",
