The commenters expressed mixed opinions on the matter, with some highlighting the importance of both while others felt that success is primarily determined by connections and timing. Many agreed that hard work and a strong strategy are crucial for success, but acknowledged that having the right connections and being in the right place at the right time can greatly impact one's chances of success. The main concerns raised were the feeling that success in entrepreneurship seems unattainable for many due to the potential barriers of not having the right connections or being in the right place at the right time. The overall sentiment among the commenters was one of frustration and skepticism, with some admitting that they have personally struggled to make their entrepreneurial dreams a reality despite their hard work and strategic efforts. The comment with the most upvotes highlighted the importance of perseverance and being open to learning and adapting in the face of challenges and setbacks in the pursuit of success as an entrepreneur.",
