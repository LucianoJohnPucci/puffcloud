    "Title": "The Reddit post follows the story of a struggling small business run by a couple, who are facing financial constraints despite a positive trend. They employ five hourly workers, one of whom is underperforming and has requested paid time off (PTO) and paid holidays, which may result in them leaving if their demands are not met. The owners are hesitant to provide PTO due to their financial situation and are questioning the norm of granting it to hourly workers. The highest-paid employee is making $20/hr, while the others receive $17/hr plus tips. The commenters agree that providing PTO is important for employee satisfaction and retention, and suggest alternative ways to make it feasible for the business, such as reducing the number of employees and/or cutting the hours of the highest-paid worker to accommodate PTO for the others. However, some voiced concerns about creating a precedent for future requests and the issue of fairness among employees. The overall sentiment is empathetic towards the couple's struggles and balancing the needs of their employees, with several commenters offering potential solutions. The top-rated comment with the most upvotes states, \"I understand the hesitation, but PTO is a vital part of employee satisfaction. Maybe you could offer it on a case by case basis or start with smaller increments of time.\"",
