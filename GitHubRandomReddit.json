    "Link": "A recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business spent $100 over 21 days and generated 1,800 impressions and 7 calls, yielding a cost per call of $14.28 and a conversion rate of 57% (4 out of 7 calls led to jobs booked). The campaign revealed that most callers had immediate needs, indicating buyer intent. While the results were satisfactory, with a decent return on ad spend (ROAS), it averaged only one call every three days. Future plans include refining keyword targeting and creating specific ad groups for the client's four departments to improve campaign effectiveness.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses the results of a recent Google Call Ads campaign for a local sign business, which spent $100 over 21 days and resulted in 1,800 impressions and 7 calls with a conversion rate of 57%. Most callers demonstrated immediate needs, indicating strong buyer intent. While the campaign yielded a satisfactory return on ad spend (ROAS) and plans are in place to refine keyword targeting and create specific ad groups, the main concern raised by commenters was the low frequency of calls (averaging only one every three days). The overall sentiment was positive, with many agreeing that the campaign showed promising potential and touting the usefulness of tracking buyer intent. The most upvoted comment highlighted the importance of evaluating the cost per acquisition (CPA) rather than just the cost per call in judging the effectiveness of the campaign.",
