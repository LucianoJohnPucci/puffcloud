    "Title": "This Reddit post sparked a discussion on a commonly given but poor piece of advice to entrepreneurs: that a good product will sell itself. Redditors shared their own experiences and emphasized the importance of effective marketing and online engagement in countering this misconception. Many agreed that while a good product is essential, it is not enough on its own without a solid marketing strategy. Key positive points included the recognition of the value of marketing and the importance of connecting with potential customers through various channels. Main concerns raised included the danger of relying solely on the quality of a product and overlooking the need for effective advertising and customer engagement. The overall sentiment seemed to be that while having a good product is important, a strong marketing strategy and active online presence are crucial for success. The comment with the most upvotes echoed this sentiment, stating, \"Marketing and engagement are key for any business, no matter how great the product is. Without it, even the best products will struggle to find customers.\"",
