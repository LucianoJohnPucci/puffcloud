    "Link": "In Spring 2017, a college student began trading Steam skins with a small investment, eventually developing a trading site for Rust with the help of a programmer, Michel. By the end of 2017, the business had grown significantly, reaching 16,000 users and generating $1,100 monthly profit. However, by Winter 2018, profits declined due to marketing challenges and increased expenses. After ceasing development to focus on school, the owner sold 90% of the site for $2,200 in Spring 2019. Key takeaways include learning about development, marketing, and entrepreneurship, and ultimately withdrawing over $12,000 in profits from initial investments. The experience fostered a newfound interest in the business world.",

Despite facing challenges, the owner was able to withdraw over $12,000 in profits and learn important lessons about development, marketing, and entrepreneurship. While some commenters were impressed by the owner's success, others expressed concern about the decline in profits and the decision to sell the site. Overall, the majority of commenters had a positive sentiment towards the owner's experience, with the most upvoted comment being \"That's impressive for a college student!\"",
