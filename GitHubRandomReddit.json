    "Title": "In this Reddit post, the user brings up the topic of managing finances for their business. They mention having a gross profit of 25% and their strategy of keeping separate business checking/savings accounts and a credit card. While they understand the importance of paying themselves, they are unsure of the frequency since their business has not launched yet. Many commenters commend the user for their organized approach to financial management and suggest keeping a buffer in their savings account for unexpected expenses. However, some raise concerns about the potential impact of credit card debt on the business and advise the user to track their expenses closely. The overall sentiment of the commenters is mixed, with some expressing confidence in the user's financial strategy while others offer cautionary advice. The top rated comment encourages the user to pay themselves regularly but also have a budget for personal expenses, stating \"paying yourself is important, but not at the expense of the business.\" [This is a good point. Just be sure to set aside enough for the business to grow, and your personal budget for \"must have\" expenses]",
