    "Title": "The Reddit post in question describes a frustrating situation where a customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a 30-day return policy and 100% satisfaction guarantee. However, after realizing the item was not suitable, the customer returned it at their own expense of $14 for shipping. Unfortunately, the item was marked as \"unclaimed\" by USPS and was returned to the seller. The customer reached out to the business for a refund, but was met with refusal to cover the return shipping cost and insistence on receiving the item back before processing the refund, resulting in an additional $14 expense for the customer. The commenters express frustration with the business for not honoring their return policy fairly and understand the customer's frustration. They also highlight the importance of clear and specific return policies from businesses. The overall sentiment is one of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the business's actions. The top upvoted comment states, \"This is not fair to the customer at all. As a business, you should honor your return policy and not make the customer pay for your mistakes.\"",
