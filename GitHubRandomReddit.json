The example suggests that if the business grows by 10% annually, it could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. The author questions the realism of consistent 10% annual growth for a decade and seeks insights on small business niches or scenarios that could achieve this profile.",

    "Title": "In Walter Deibel's book \"Buy then Build,\" he presents a scenario of acquisition entrepreneurship where a business generating $1.5M in revenue and $200K in SDE can be purchased for $1M with a $100K personal investment and 90% SBA loan. The example suggests that with a 10% annual growth, the business could be sold for $3-4M in ten years. There were generally positive points made by commenters, with some noting that the scenario may not be attainable for everyone, but it does showcase the potential of leveraging SBA loans for acquisition entrepreneurship. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of consistent 10% growth for a decade and the risk of investing such a large portion of personal funds in one business. The overall sentiment of the commenters was cautiously optimistic, with some offering specific niches or industries that could potentially achieve this level of growth. The most upvoted comment was one that mentioned the importance of thorough due diligence and a solid business plan for sustained growth.",
