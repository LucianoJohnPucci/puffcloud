    "Title": "In this Reddit post, a customer recounts their frustrating experience with a small business that offers a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction\" guarantee. The customer purchased a $50 item but returned it when they realized it wasn't suitable, paying a $14 shipping fee. However, due to three failed delivery attempts by USPS, the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender. The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before issuing a refund, causing the customer to face an additional $14 cost. The main positive points raised by commenters include appreciation for the customer's patience and understanding of the business's policy. The most concerning issue for commenters is the business's refusal to cover return shipping costs and the added burden placed on the customer. The overall sentiment of the commenters is one of frustration and disappointment towards the business for not honoring their return policy. The most upvoted comment states, \"Unclaimed packages are the responsibility of the sender. If the seller wants the item back, they should cover return shipping. This is just good customer service.\"",
