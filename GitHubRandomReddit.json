    "Title": "The original Reddit post brings attention to the common but misguided belief that a good product will automatically sell itself. The comments from fellow entrepreneurs provide valuable insights and experiences that highlight the importance of effective marketing strategies and online engagement in the success of a product or business. Key points include the need for a solid marketing plan, utilizing social media and other online platforms, and staying connected with target audiences. Concerns raised by commenters include the potential financial risks of relying solely on the product's quality, and the necessity of constantly adapting and evolving in a competitive market. Overall, the sentiment among commenters is that while a good product is a crucial starting point, successful businesses require active and strategic marketing efforts to truly thrive. The top-rated comment from user u/Lunatic06 summarizes this sentiment well, stating \"A good product will give you a head start, but it won't do the work for you.\"",
