    "Title": "This Reddit post discusses a small business owner who has been sued for website inaccessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), despite using an official Shopify theme and approved accessible apps. The post has generated a lot of discussion and highlights the frustration and concerns of both small business owners and disabled individuals.\n\nMany commenters praised the business owner for proactively trying to make their website accessible and expressed sympathy for the cost and stress of the lawsuit. Some pointed out that it's unfair for small businesses to bear the burden of ensuring website accessibility, and called for more accountability from web providers like Shopify.\n\nOne main concern raised is the lack of clear guidelines for website accessibility, making it difficult for businesses to know if they are compliant or not. Some suggested that the ADA needs to be updated to address the complexities of website accessibility in the digital age. Others brought attention to the fact that disabled individuals face barriers on the internet every day and should have equal access to online businesses.\n\nOverall, there is a strong sentiment among commenters that this lawsuit is unfair and highlights the need for more support and resources for small businesses in regards to website accessibility. The most upvoted comment by user \"RightToMainsplain\" stated, \"It's unfortunate that lawsuits are being used as a means of enforcement instead of proactive measures being taken, but as a disabled person, I appreciate any efforts towards making the web more accessible.\"",
