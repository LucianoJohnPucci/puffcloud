    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's experience with a small business that offers a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee policy. After returning an unsuitable $50 item, the customer was charged $14 for shipping when the package was marked as \"unclaimed\" and returned to the sender by USPS. The business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in frustration and consideration of a chargeback by the customer. Many commenters praised the business for having a return policy, but raised concerns about the additional cost and inconvenience faced by the customer. The overall sentiment is that while the business has a favorable return policy, they should also cover the return shipping cost as a gesture of good customer service. The comment with the most upvotes states, \"The business needs to uphold their guarantee and make it right for the customer, regardless of the extra cost on their end.\"",
