    "Link": "A small business owner with over a decade of experience is struggling with declining sales this year, largely due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The business primarily ships via FedEx, as most packages exceed a cubic foot, while UPS offers no discounts. Attempts to lower shipping costs resulted in losses, leading to price hikes that didn?t help sales. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy. They seek advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS.",

    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a small business owner's struggle with declining sales, primarily due to high shipping costs. After surveying abandoned cart customers, it was found that nearly 90% cited shipping prices as a deterrent. The owner has received unsolicited offers from Unishippers but found them untrustworthy, and so they are seeking advice on obtaining better shipping rates from FedEx and UPS. Many commenters suggest negotiating with FedEx and UPS or switching to other carriers, such as USPS or regional carriers. Some also suggest looking into third-party shipping solutions or offering free shipping with a minimum purchase. The main concern raised is the impact of high shipping costs on the business's sales and profitability. The overall sentiment is sympathetic and offers practical solutions, with the top comment receiving the most upvotes stating, \"I would definitely look into working with a third-party logistics company that can offer better rates and discounts.\"",
