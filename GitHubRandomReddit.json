    "Title": "The post on Reddit discusses the author's experience as a business owner, starting in 2007 and surviving the 2008 crash while working from home. The author and their husband are both self-employed, and despite facing challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs, they were able to continue operating. However, due to the increasing costs, the business has become unsustainable and the author is now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor. While many commenters were impressed by the author's resilience and ability to survive during tough times, others raised concerns about the long-term viability of relying on a single contract and the potential impact on the author's client loyalty. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was sympathetic towards the author's situation and hopeful for the success of their business. The top-rated comment was one that acknowledged the author's determination and offered words of encouragement: \"You've been through tough times and you've made it this far, I believe in you and your ability to make the right decision for your business.\"",
