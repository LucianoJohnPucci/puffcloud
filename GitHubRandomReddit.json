    "Title": "In the Reddit post, a college student seeks advice for their mother's struggling high-end women's clothing store in a high-income suburb. The store specializes in classy dresses for a \"mother of the bride\" audience, but despite the mother's 20 years of experience and past successes, the physical store has low foot traffic and is facing financial difficulties. The student hopes for strategies to improve business, but also considers closing the store as an option. The commenters mainly highlight the store's unique offerings, such as custom dresses and jean resizing, as potential strengths. However, concerns are raised about the store's pricing range and its location in a high-end suburb, which may not be the ideal market for the target audience. Overall, the sentiment among the commenters is empathetic towards the mother's struggle and provides practical suggestions rather than just dismissing the store's potential. The top upvoted comment suggests reaching out to existing customers through email marketing and offering promotions or discounts.",
