    "Title": "In this Reddit post, Redditors discuss the concept of prioritizing building sustainable businesses that provide freedom and comfort, rather than striving for extreme wealth or success. The post cautions against burnout, unrealistic goals, and neglecting relationships, and advocates for a balanced approach to work and personal life. The overall sentiment of the commenters is that while success and wealth are important, they should not come at the cost of one's mental and physical well-being and personal relationships. The most upvoted comment by user u/PolarOpposite sums up this sentiment by stating, \"Success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure.\" Many commenters also stress the importance of defining one's own version of success and not falling into the trap of societal expectations. The main concern raised is the pressure and stress placed on entrepreneurs to constantly strive for more and the negative effects it can have on their mental health and personal lives. Overall, commenters agree that a balanced and sustainable approach to building a business is key, with a focus on creating a profitable business that allows for a comfortable life rather than chasing material possessions.",
