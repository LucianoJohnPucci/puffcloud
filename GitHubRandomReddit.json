    "Link": "A customer ordered a $50 item from a small business with a \"30-day return\" and \"100% satisfaction guarantee.\" After realizing the item wasn't suitable, they returned it, paying $14 for shipping. However, USPS marked the package as \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts, and it was returned to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to pay for the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item to process the refund, resulting in the customer facing an additional $14 cost. The customer is frustrated and considering a chargeback, feeling the business is not honoring its return policy fairly.",

    "Title": "This Reddit post details a customer's negative experience with a small business's return policy. The initial purchase was for a $50 item with a 30-day return and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but the customer ended up paying an additional $14 in shipping costs due to USPS marking the package as \"unclaimed.\" The business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item before processing a refund, resulting in the customer facing even more expenses. Commenters expressed frustration with the business not honoring its own policies fairly, with many suggesting a chargeback as a potential solution. The top comment with the most upvotes pointed out the mistake on the business's part and suggested they cover the return shipping costs as a gesture of good customer service.",
