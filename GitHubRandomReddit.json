    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses a customer's frustrating experience with a small business's return policy. The business advertised a 30-day return period and 100% satisfaction guarantee, but when the customer returned an item for not being suitable, USPS marked it as \"unclaimed\" and returned it to the sender. The customer contacted the business for a refund, but the business refused to cover the return shipping and insisted on receiving the item first, resulting in an additional $14 cost for the customer. \n\nSome commenters praised the customer for trying to resolve the issue before considering a chargeback, and emphasized the importance of customer service and honoring policies to maintain a good reputation. Others appreciated the customer's honesty and desire to support small businesses, but also advised them to be cautious in the future and read return policies carefully. \n\nMany concerns were raised about the business's lack of transparency and responsibility in the situation. Some commented on the legal implications of the situation, while others shared similar experiences and questioned the business's ethics. Overall, the sentiment of the commenters was that the business was not handling the situation fairly or in line with their advertised policies, and that the customer has the right to seek a chargeback if necessary. \n\nThe top voted comment pointed out the flaw in the business's logic, stating, \"Why should the customer have to pay return shipping when it wasn't their fault that USPS marked the package as unclaimed?\" This comment received 269 upvotes and highlights the general consensus among commenters that the customer should not be responsible for the additional return shipping cost.",
