    "Title": "The Reddit community responded with a mixture of understanding and frustration to a small business owner's post about being sued for website inaccessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Many commenters sympathize with the business owner and recognize the importance of making websites accessible for people with disabilities. They also acknowledge that the owner did their due diligence by using an official Shopify theme and accessible apps. However, there is concern about the lack of a warning or opportunity to fix the issue before being sued, and the high cost and potential harm to small business owners. The overall sentiment leans towards the need for more education and accountability from Shopify and other web providers. The top upvoted comment suggests that this issue is not unique to Shopify and calls for collective action to address the problem.",
