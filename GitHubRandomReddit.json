    "Title": "The Reddit post discusses the author's experience of starting a successful business in 2007 after 18 years at a failing company, utilizing their 22 years of experience and client loyalty. The author and their spouse are both self-employed and managed to survive the 2008 crash by working from home and avoiding real estate costs. However, despite enduring the COVID-19 pandemic, rising costs (up 50% in 2020) have made the business unsustainable. The author is now considering a part-time 1099 contract with a long-term vendor, acknowledging their luck in not having to close down in 2020 like many other small businesses. The discussion is largely positive, with commenters applauding the author's resilience and successful business model. However, concerns were raised about the sustainability of the new part-time contract and the potential loss of autonomy. The overall sentiment is one of admiration for the author's determination and optimism for the future of their business. The most upvoted comment highlights the importance of adapting to changing market conditions and the value of flexibility in small businesses.",
